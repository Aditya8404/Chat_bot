Inception (2010),"My 3rd time watching this movie! Yet, it still stunned my mind, kept me enjoyed its every moment and left me with many thoughts afterward.For someone like me, who've rarely slept without dream, it's so exciting watching how Christopher Nolan had illustrated every single characteristic of dream on the big screen. As it's been done so sophisticatedly, I do believe the rumour that Nolan had spent 10 years to finish the script of Inception. In my opinion, it's been so far the greatest achievement in his brilliant writer-director career. I jumped into this conclusion after making a quick benchmark of Nolan's remarkable works:
Memento, as his first signature in the cinema history, is tremendous and has stayed the most mind-bending film I've ever seen. But overall, it doesn't reach the same level of Inception.The Prestige is highly impressive but somehow I haven't been able to find the very particular ""Nolan's spirit"" in it.The Batman Trilogy is the best superhero saga of all time and its peak The Dark Knight is no doubt a masterpiece as well. Nonetheless, every time we talk about it, Heath Ledger takes all the spotlights with his life-time-role: The (unique-and-only) Joker.Then there came Inception where Nolan truly stood out, having every single detail of his work done in the finest way. The multi-layered storyline despite its complexity, remains consistent and originally interesting. From visual aspect, everything was masterly handled: an impeccable cross-cutting allowed the movie to follow Nolan's nonlinear story-telling without being scattered; a wonderful cinematography work completed with incredibly imaginative visual-effects brought into life so many breathtaking scenes, some of them, I believe, will stay in the audience's mind for a long time (city bending in Paris, zero-gravity fight, in limbo, dreams collapsing...). In addition, Nolan had also a solid cast ensemble to help him deliver all of his messages.Later, we had Interstellar. Though I did admire its cinematography and visual-effects, the film itself is nowhere near the level of Inception.
SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!! For all who haven't watched this movie, you may stop the reading right here because the following paragraphs contain a ton of spoilers!It is set in the world where there's technology that allows people to literally share dream. There is, in this world, a new kind of corporate spy - ""extractors"" who use this technology to infiltrate the target's subconscious and extract valuable information through a shared dream world. Our hero Mr Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio), a very well-known extractor, and his partner Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are approached by a powerful businessman - Mr Saito (Ken Watanabe) for a nearly impossible mission, something no one has ever done before : instead of stealing, he wants them to plant an idea in a person's subconscious, which is also called ""inception"". In return, Saito offers something that Cobb could never resist: a ticket to go home with his children by taking out the homicide charge against him. So Cobb and Arthur gather a team to carry out the mission: Eames (Tom Hardy) - a veteran identity forger, Yusuf - the only one chemist can make such a powerful sedative for such a complex 3-levels ""dream within a dream"", and Ariadne (Ellen Page) - a newbie but remarkably talented architect whose role is critical for the success of the mission. The target is Robert Fischer (Cillian Murphy) - son and heir of Saito's biggest competitor (Maurice Fischer, who's dying). The goal is to seed an idea into his mind which will make him abandon his father's business, and the team has to carry Saito as visitor in their mission to let him verify the result of inception. While the team go deeper and deeper into Fischer's mind, we discover gradually the dark of Cobb's past, as well as the 2 biggest why concerning our hero: Why he has became such an expert of inception and What is his desperate motivation for taking that insane mission.The movie is not only about the inception mission but more importantly, about the struggle of finding the way in the maze of life. In Cobb's case, it's the maze of dreams built by his memories with his past wife Mal (Marion Cotillard) and his regrets. So as long as he let himself consumed by the past by blaming himself for the death of his love wife, it will keep coming back and haunt his present: the deeper the team go into dream, the more dangerous his subconscious, under the form of his ghostly wife, comes out and could anytime jeopardize the mission. Indeed, if we apprehend the movie with these 2 layers of its story, the ending scene makes perfect sense. Yes! We're now talking about that famous ending which has still remained one of the most controversial movie endings in the cinema history. Did Cobb find Mr Saito in limbo, bring he back to complete the mission then come back to his children in the real world? Or they are still stuck in limbo - the infinite dream world, and the last scene was just his big dream? But all of those question only matter in the first layer of the story: the result of inception mission. When we perceive the story in its deeper layer, as a journey for Cobb to let go of his feeling of guilt for the past and re-find the meaning of his life, this ending did fulfill its job. Cobb didn't even stay to see either if the spinning top would fall because he didn't care any more, what's important to him is that he gonna be with his kids. He did finally get rid of his haunting past and be able to move on, and that matters. And after all, dream or reality, the importance is to truly live. So from this point of view, he has solved the maze of his life.
Some short lines about the cast:
Leo has done justice to our main character but he did not success to make a leap from his previous similar roles in Shutter Island and Blood Diamond.Joseph Gordon-Levitt could have been more intense, given the fact that he had the most astounding fight scene in the movie (zero-gravity sequence).There was something missing in Ken Watanabe's performance to portray the powerful man who sponsored the crazy mission. Maybe it was his English...Tom Hardy was OK but forgettable because his character didn't have any memorable moment though he had a lot of screen time.Ellen Page was really impressive, she did fully illustrate the cleverness and the keenness of the young brilliant architect. And personally, I did find a lot of charms in her acting.Cillian Murphy has also done a great job. Much more emotionally complex than just a target of the inception mission, his character Robert Fischer, at the end, was not so different than our hero Cobb. They both were struggling to find a way out of their own maze. If for Cobb, it was the painful past with his late wife; for Fischer, it was the grand shadow and the lack of recognition of his late dad.Last but not least, the one who impressed me the most was Marion. Mal was so beautiful and mysterious in a very unique haunting way, mostly with her speaking eyes! And for me, she is the most remarkable character of the movie.",10/10
Inception (2010),"You only get to watch this for the first time once, so choose your state of mind carefully.
It is a film about movies and dreams and reality, and what sort of life it is best to find when you leave the cinema and return to whatever you left to enter.
It is spectacular, and brutal, and enigmatic and disturbing.
It is beautiful and absorbing.
It is about one of my favourite characters ever to grace the screen.
I don't see it often, in case it's not as good as I like to remember it.
That is my secret, that I lock away in my safe in the basement.
That somewhere there is a perfect world for us all.
For some, perhaps it is in the cinema watching this.",10/10
Inception (2010),"When you wake up from a good dream, you feel the reality is harsh. When you wake up after a bad dream, you will be sentimentally attached to the beauty of reality. But as long as life is good, reality and dreams don't matter.",10/10
Inception (2010),"What is the most resilient parasite? An Idea! Yes, Nolan has created something with his unbelievably, incredibly and god- gifted mind which will blow the minds of the audience away. The world premiere of the movie, directed by Hollywood's most inventive dreamers, was shown in London and has already got top notch reviews worldwide and has scored maximum points! Now the question arises what the movie has that it deserve all this?Dom Cobb(Di Caprio) is an extractor who is paid to invade the dreams of various business tycoons and steal their top secret ideas. Cobb robs forcefully the psyche with practiced skill, though he's increasingly haunted by the memory of his late wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who has a nasty habit of showing up in his subconscious and wreaking havoc on his missions. Cobb had been involved so much in his heist work that he had lost his love!But then, as fate had decided, a wealthy business man Saito( Ken Watanabe) hands over the responsibility of dissolving the empire of his business rival Robert Fischer Jr.(Cillian Murphy). But this time his job was not to steal the idea but to plant a new one: 'Inception'Then what happens is the classic heist movie tradition. To carry out the the task, Cobb's 'brainiac' specialists team up again with him, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), his longtime organizer; Tom Hardy (Eames), a ""forger"" who can shapeshift at will; and Yusuf (Dileep Rao), a powerful sedative supplier.There is only one word to describe the cinematography, the set designs and the special effects, and that is Exceptional! You don't just watch the scenes happening, you feel them. The movie is a real thrill ride. The action scenes are well picturised and the music by Hans Zimmer is electronically haunting. Never, in the runtime of the movie, you will get a chance to move your eyes from the screen to any other object.Leonardo, who is still popularly known for Jack Dawson played by him in Titanic, should be relieved as his role as Dom Cobb will be remembered forever. His performance may or may not fetch him an Oscar but it will be his finest performance till date. The supporting cast too did an extraordinary work. Christopher Nolan, ah! What a man he is. His work is nothing less than a masterpiece and he deserves all the awards in the 'Best Director' category. If ""Inception"" is a metaphysical puzzle, it's also a metaphorical one: It's hard not to draw connections between Cobb's dream-weaving and Nolan's film making, intended to seduce us, mess with our heads and leave an ever-lasting impression.To conclude, I would just say before your life ends, do yourself a favor by experiencing this exceptionally lucid classic created by Nolan!My Rating: 10/10Thanks & Regards.",10/10
Inception (2010),"Films about dreams and the subconscious are usually not very straightforward and almost always weird. ""Inception"" is no exception to that rule, but like its cinematic predecessors who have explored the contrast between and the questions of what is real and what is illusion (i.e. ""The Matrix"" (1999), ""The Cell"" (2000), ""Abre Los Ojos"" (1997) & its American remake ""Vanilla Sky"" (2001)), you really can't look away, nor should you.""Inception"" is an excellent and breathtaking movie that may be one of the only films released so far during the Summer of 2010 that lives up to its hype. It is a nearly perfect and highly original film that holds your attention until the credits roll. The less you know about this movie going in, the more you will be entranced by seeing it.Leonardo DiCaprio plays Dom Cobb, a world class criminal who, with the help of a team of sleep experts, works his way into people's subconscious and steals what people value most: ideas directly from their minds. In his last assignment to possibly clear his name, he is assigned not to steal an idea from someone, but to plant one inside that person's mind. The difficulty comes when certain people are trained to block their ideas from being taken.That plot summary only covers the basics of this pretty complicated story, but to describe every plot detail would take away the magic of this film you must see yourself to believe. DiCaprio is good in his role, but unlike many other films he has starred in, this is perhaps his only role where his character alone does not carry the weight of the movie on his shoulders or share it equally with one other co-star. Instead, this great ensemble cast teams together to make this movie work, just as their characters collaborate to pull off such a unique heist. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, and Tom Hardy are especially good in their roles.The special effects in this film were also very good, which is amazing considering their simplicity compared to the ""Matrix"" movies. There are slow-motion shots, but no impossible kung fu fighting sequences. It's especially interesting when the film gets into the architecture of certain dreams, and impossible sequences are filmed in a way I've never seen other than in drawings.However, the special effects would mean nothing if the story wasn't good. For this reason, even something as simple as a spinning top holds your attention in a way you would never think it would when seeing it in this film. The credit here can be given to writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has not made a bad film yet. There are many twists and turns in this film, but Nolan never loses his focus in the process of telling the story. If Nolan does not get nominated for Best Director and/or Best Original Screenplay next Oscar season, there is something terribly wrong with the Academy.That being said, there was still a lot about this film I still don't get, and may require multiple viewings to better understand. However, some of the best films I've seen are confusing at first. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) is a film I've seen a couple of times, and still don't understand completely. It still has a major following, though, as I'm positive this movie will. It's an incredibly entertaining movie, but it also makes you think and continues to do so after you leave the theater.",10/10
Inception (2010),"This review is being written by a 46 year-old guy. I mention this because clearly this is a film where age is important, as younger folks probably will enjoy the movie more--and can take the fast-paced action and frenetic pace. I assume older audiences probably will be a little less amazed and a bit overwhelmed with the film. Just something to consider as you read this.As for the movie, I'll be up front about the fact that I did NOT love this film. It's just not the sort of movie I'd usually see and only went because my oldest daughter nagged me to go. I am glad I did, however, as I really could respect the movie in many ways. First, the story is wildly original (though, also quite confusing). Other than the Matrix films, I can't think of anything that even comes close to it in style. Second, the production looked and sounded great. The music was intense and worked great with the amazing, totally amazing, special effects. Third, it was nice to see so many kid actors show that they are NOT light-weights and could act. Leonardo DiCaprio is no longer the pretty young thing he was in ""Titanic""--his maturity and grit were welcome. Also, seeing the kid from ""Third Rock"" suddenly playing an action hero was great--you'd barely recognize him--or the other grown child actors. Fourth, I loved the ending--it really pulled everything together very well.So why am I not giving the film a glowing review? Well, I am simply not an action film fan. And, the insane pace, TONS of shooting and crazy plot simply lost me at times. I much preferred the slower and more introspective moments of the film. Also, while Ken Watanabe is a fine actor, I had a devil of a time understanding a lot of what he said--to the point where I wish they'd either dubbed him or had caption! Now this is NOT just because I am an old crank who is slightly hard of hearing--my daughter, too, found his thick accent difficult. On the other hand, Ms. Cotillard was VERY easy to understand and I was surprised how well she controlled her lovely French accent.I could probably go on and on about the film--as it's long, complex and VERY prone to be one to watch and re-watch and discuss with friends. However, at this point, there are already a bazillion reviews and 7 billion people have already gone to see it, so I'll call it a day.Well worth seeing....but perhaps too frenetic and confusing for many.",8/10
Inception (2010),"Wait, did i just watch this or is it just a dream?",8/10
Inception (2010),"The 20th Century had Casablanca, Star Wars, the Godfather, Blade Runner, and others - this is the first of the 21st Century masterpieces. Truly in awe at how amazing this movie is, an astounding show of all aspects of films. Amazing story and cinematography accompanied with actors worthy of telling the tale. Remarkable and breathtaking.",10/10
Inception (2010),"I'm nearly at a loss for words. Just when you thought Christopher Nolan couldn't follow up to ""The Dark Knight"", he does it again, delivering another masterpiece, one with so much power and rich themes that has been lost from the box office for several years. Questioning illusions vs reality usually makes the film weird, but Nolan grips your attention like an iron claw that you just can't help watching and wondering what will happen next. That is a real powerful skill a director has. No wonder Warner Bros. put their trust in him, he is THAT good of a director, and over-hyping a Christopher Nolan film, no matter what the film is about, is always an understatement instead of an overestimate like MANY films before.Not since the eras of Stanley Kubrick, Andrei Tarkovsky and Alfred Hitchcock has there been a more brilliant director than Christopher Nolan. He is, undoubtedly, one of THE most brilliant and gifted Hollywood filmmakers in history. Filmmakers like him come but just once in a lifetime. He has the ability to seduce our eyes, ears and most importantly, mind, and then delivers what he intends to deliver in full blast. Rarely have blockbusters have the gall to deliver such amounts imagination and intelligence at the same time. And yes, it is similar to the excellent anime film ""Paprika"" in the whole ""invading dreams"" plot, but the similarities end there as Nolan brings the film to a whole different level.Visuals and intelligence rarely come together in movies at the same time, it's either all-visuals-no-smarts (""G.I. Joe"", ""Transformers"") or the exact opposite (""Doubt"", ""Invictus""). In this film the excellently directed action sequences combined with immensely groundbreaking and jaw-dropping visual effects are combined smoothly with a heavy dose of intelligence and believability.Although having an ensemble cast and financed by a Hollywood giant studio (Warner Bros), this film is a very personal film for Nolan, he wrote the film as well as directing it, and as you watch the film you get many glimpses of Nolan's perplexing, increasingly imaginative thoughts and dreams in the dialog that he writes and the plot that he sets up. Ideas have never felt more interesting and put to good use than in this film. This film is NOT for the popcorn muncher, rather it is a film for thinkers. Honestly I can't explain the plot for fear of spoiling the movie for you readers. Even the slightest hint will ruin the experience. The viewer will walk out of the cinema feeling dazed, confused and ultimately breathless. It's like a puzzle, both physically and mentally, and you have to pay attention throughout the film for the clues. However Nolan controls the spectacle of the film and is careful not to let it overwhelm the film's humanity, and this is where ""Inception"" shines. It is a very deep film that will have one thinking and asking questions for years to come. That's right, years.Once the film ends, you'll want to watch it again, for there's something new every time. This is a film that requires multiple viewing for someone to truly comprehend the film's ambiguous themes, and will be discussed by many in the future. This is an original film, no adaptation, no sequel/prequel, no remake/reboot, which is extremely refreshing having gone nearly three years of mostly unremarkable visual effects roadshows (""Avatar"" be damned).Of course, a film is not complete without the actors. Leo DiCaprio delivers an Oscar worthy performance, similar but better than his previous effort ""Shutter Island"". He shows glimpses of a flawed, grim, fragile man, who has knowledge about everything else but yet can't seem to come in grips with himself and his demons. Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Dileep Rao, Cillian Murphy, Tom Berenger, Michael Caine, Marion Cottilard, Pete Postlethwaite, Lukas Haas... Nolan really brings out the best in this unusual yet extremely talented group of supporting actors who make their roles their own.Nolan is of course, a master behind the camera, a real virtuoso when it comes to film. His direction is taut, focused, gripping, and extraordinarily fascinating. The detailed and complex original script is no surprise from Nolan, considering the fact that he turned Batman the superhero into pop-culture art two years ago (""The Dark Knight""). The action sequences are unique, exciting and fresh, something absent from the cinema which has since been interested at things popping towards the screen and stuff blowing up every two milliseconds. The visual effects are awesome and imaginative, and best of all they do not bring down the movie's quality one bit, rather it makes the movie more fascinating to watch. The cinematography is absolutely, beautifully shot, so we can see the action and emotion in all their glory. Production design is top notch, with terrific design of sets and locations. Hans Zimmer's complementing music score is simply outstanding, and knowing the man, that's really all I have to say. Together all of these elements combine to deliver a mesmerizing movie experience like no other this year.Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He truly is a gifted filmmaker, arguably the most imaginative in Hollywood today. And ""Inception"" can proudly stand alongside ""Blade Runner"" and ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" as science-fiction masterpieces that push the boundaries for movie making and become a different experience altogether.There are two types of films: the crowd-pleasing blockbuster and the intelligent indie/art film. Nolan has combined two of these tropes together into one exceptionally brilliant package, pulling off that rare, now nearly-extinct Movie Magic that has since been wiped off the planet by sequelitis and reboots. Movie of Summer 2010? Movie of 2010? Heck this is possibly the first masterpiece of the decade! Nolan is a genius and I applaud him for treating his audiences as intelligent people.Missing this film and not getting the film's point is a crime.Overall value: 9/10 (Excellent)",8/10
Inception (2010),"Inception is my number one favorite movie off my twelve years on earth! It's absolutely impossible to explain the incredible that Inception has. Inception is Sooooooooo dang exciting, edge of seat, mind blower, and I wish there were more movies like it and more Christopher Nolans out there. Congratulations to the well deserved best director, writer, and producer of films (in my opinion). Also the acting is fabulous, everyone did an amazing job, and Leonardo was fabulous at explaining the dream concept. Also the CGI and effects are amazing. Go watch Inception because it is incredibly amazing in every aspect, and is my number one film of my twelve years on earth. Bravo to the Inception crew and wow at this fabulous movie!",10/10
Inception (2010),"Inception is as original as you can get with a sci-fi movie. I feel like it's kind of pointless to compare this to Blade Runner, Aliens, Terminator 2, 2001: A Space Odyssey or any other sci-fi blockbusters, for they're completely different. What Nolan crafted is genius, in my mind he is still yet to make a bad movie, it is now time to get into spoiler territory.Inception is a story about dreams, how you can build anything you want, Nolan took 10 years to write the screenplay and it was definitely worth-while, this is one of the most mind-blowing, nail-biting, epic action packed science fiction movies of all time. All the performances in this film are amazing, the special effects are flawless, the acting is flawless, the story is flawless, the writing is flawless, this is one of a few pictures that just got everything right in all categories, most people saw there is no such thing as a flawless movie and I would 100% love to disagree with them there, all of the Christopher Nolan movies I have seen so far have no real flaws. Leonardo DiCaprio+Christopher Nolan= pure gold, these two should definitely collaborate more, Inception just proves that Chris is a cinematic God, from his screenplays, to his production, to his film direction, everything is perfect!You have to imagine it to believe it. Watching it once isn't enough, watching it twice isn't enough, you have got to watch this 10 times or even more to really get the true essence of why this movie is considered to be one of the greatest of all time. It is truly film-making at it's greatest! It is one of the most re-watch-able movies a director has ever put out! It's like Dark Knight, Memento and most of his other work where immediately after you watch it you feel like watching it again.At times it gets confusing because sometimes it feels like it's the real world when it is actually the dream world and Leonardo DiCaprio's performance, oh my god! In my opinion it is his greatest performance. And Inception SHOULD HAVE WON BEST PICTURE! Fun fact: This film got nominated for Best Screenplay and many other Oscar nominations, yet they don't nominate the man who put it all together who DIRECTED THE GOSH-DARN MASTERPIECE!I watch this film at least twice a week and to see that Watchmojo put Social Network higher than Inception on their Top 10 Movies of the Decade list p*sses me off! Yeah, it's David Fincher, I get that Watchmojo love David Fincher, but higher than Inception? NAH!If anybody else directed this it would be an average, unoriginal and completely unimaginative piece of work. When Nolan gets his hands on something it is always going to be original, classic and everything great about movies. I'd place this on my top 5 films of the century list, most films on that list would include Nolan films because he is the best director working today and you have to accept that.More will be added soon...",10/10
Inception (2010),"I'd like to keep my review rather to the point.Pros: 1. its theme - dream is a fascinating topic to say the least. There are a lot of unknowns in dreamworld. 2. its plot - there are several sweet twists and unpredictable turns. 3. its edgy drive - although you know what's coming next, still you feel jumpy about it when it does.4. its rapid storyline - the story moves fast from one scene to another, making the viewers feel like on a roller coaster ride. At times, it's hard to keep up, even after watching it several times. 5. its sophistication - there is a lot of information to remember and digest. This is the very thing the modern moviegoers are after, I believe. 6. its realism - okay, pun intended. The movie explains (or at least tries to) the ins and outs of what dream is about and how it functions, some of which are very familiar with and dear to us.Cons: 1. its poor character development - although the acting was convincing enough there was not enough of character development. I wonder how many people really felt connected to the main character(s) after watching the movie. Yes, the movie talks about emotional struggles but it was more of an action film than anything else, if you ask me. 2. too many distractions - I found that the movie had more characters than necessary. They may play certain roles in the plot but they seemed more of distractions than anything else. I wish the movie was more focused. 3. a bit preachy - I noticed that the characters would explain things about dreamworld and then the exact things happen later in the movie. I'm afraid, Inception overused this trick. In conclusion, its theme is fascinating but its delivery is not without room for improvement. I highly recommend you to go and read Somewhere carnal over 40 winks, if you dig this kind of flicks. Cheers!",9/10
Inception (2010),"I saw Memento very recently, something that turned out to be a great miss.I saw it again, just to make a couple of thins straight-and i'll definitely do the same with Inception.Christopher Nolan keeps improving himself, with even more complex and multilayer script like this.And i thought Memento was hard to reach by most of the viewers, but no.Inception will keep you mesmerized and captivated by the genius, that's hidden behind it.And not just directors and screenwriters (or with other words-Nolan), but with acting and sound-and effects and editing as well.When you have a cast like this-i mean Leonardo DiCaprio, Joseph Gordon-Lewitt, Michael Caine, or Marion Cotillard (a personal favourite), the movie just keeps going flawlessly.Most of the crew is the same the Nolan brothers worked with on TDK and earlier in Batman Begins.So the Oscar noms in those categories are a certainty for me.The only thing one could have against the movie, is the headache one could have.See, most of my friends go to the movies for brainless action, they enjoyed Iron Man 2 and The A-Team, but this movie-you have to see it at least twice, to understand it.The levels and the layers on which thing are happening are so many, that one surely'll miss something vital.This is a reason for not fitting to the mass audience, but i hope that won't happen, because Nolan is one of my favourite directors/writers, and he showed, that the brainless action flicks aren't all of it.There are still movies like Inception out there and still people like the Nolans to make those movies, so it's not all lost.And i hope this movie could show the audience that the story is still important for the experience one could receive, not the endless, constant explosions.Because this is really a one of a lifetime event.Saying that, i must say, that in a world full of remakes, reboots, sequels, prequels and God knows what, this is a unique chance to see something different and unmatched so far-a strong movie, that, surely will be Nolan's latest masterpiece! My Grade won't change-it's the same for all Nolan movies-sheer 10!",10/10
Inception (2010),"Inception is truly one of a kind. A concept which has long gestated in Christopher Nolan's mind, his eye for drama mixed with his large scale sensibilities ring true in Blockbuster season making Inception a true original in the sea of reboots, remakes and sequels.To try and explain Inceptions many plot twists and incredibly intelligent arcs, would be a foolish task. As Nolan himself has been reluctant to. The best way to approach the film would be with an open mind, if you are prepared to be taken on a ride of a lifetime, then trust that you 100% will. If Avatar was a seminal film in technology (although coming out as a rather poor film, in my opinion), then Inception is seminal in it's storytelling. With a 148 minute running time, you would expect a lot to take place, but what you wouldn't expect is the pace of it all. I did not think at one time in the film about how long was left. I was simply blown away by the depth in every single part of the film. If my enthusiasm for the storytelling aspect of the film has left you worried about the spectacle, then don't worry. They are, as hinted in the trailer, incredible, looking real and unbelievable simultaneously. The most pleasing thing about the action set pieces, is that they are genuinely used to illustrate the story, rather than to blow stuff up a la Michael Bay.With this complex movie in it's high concept, a stellar cast is needed. And Nolan as always, delivers with just that. This is vintage DiCaprio, perhaps only equalled in The Aviator, which is even more impressive as his role as Cobb in Inception is not a showy one, needing DiCaprio to be the constant at the centre of the film. And he pulls off Cobb's emotional contradictions sublimely. The rest of the cast members all shine in parts of the films, Cillian Murphy shows off his usually non-existent tender side, Gordon-Levitt bottles his usual charm for his confidently reserved turn as the reliable Arthur, Watanabe is devilish as the seemingly ambiguous Saito, Page shows why she's the next big female star and Tom Hardy revels in being the comic relief of the film compared to his recent turns as decidedly psychopathic characters.Overall, Nolan has indeed surpassed himself. He has created a world as expansive as his Gotham, a plot dwarfing the intricacies of Memento and one which blows The Prestige's cinematic reveal out of the water. This is truly unmissable cinema. Revel in it, we've still got to wait a whole two years before Batman 3.",10/10
Inception (2010),"Inception is written, produced, and directed by Christopher Nolan. The film stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Ken Watanabe, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Dileep Rao, Tom Berenger, and Michael Caine. The musical score is by Hans Zimmer and Wally Pfister is the cinematographer. Plot finds DiCaprio playing Dom Cobb, a specialised spy for hire who steals ideas from the dreams of people. But one day he gets a different offer, one that will enable him to see his estranged children. To get his reward he must enact Inception, the planting of an idea in the mind of the selected target. But Inception is thought impossible and should Cobb and his selected team fail? The consequences are unthinkable.There has already been much written and pondered about as regards Inception in the relatively short running time of its life. One can only imagine what will be written and said about it in ten years time. For although it's arguably a bit too early to be talking about it being held in such high regards as the likes of 2001: A Space Odyssey, it's inescapable that Nolan's movie is this current generation's sci-fi classic. That Nolan has managed to make it accessible to the mainstream, and dazzled the eyes as much as the brain in the process, is close to being a piece of genius craftsmanship.Inception is a film that it's better to know nothing about before venturing into it, and then it asks, well Nolan asks, for your undivided attention. It's neither as confusing as some have painted it, nor does it have any tricks-peek behind the curtain type-up its sleeve. The truth is is that Inception has something for everyone; thematically speaking, and that's before we pore over the special effects that sees Nolan raising the bar considerably. As is the case with twisty high concept movies, interpretations are many, with the director rightly abstaining from discourse about his movie. What forms the basis is your basic life and death struggles, with the grey areas during and after given a clever cinematic make over. There's also meditations on grief that this reviewer personally found easy to get involved with; that of course wont work for everyone, but that is just one of many strands that Nolan dangles for the discerning viewer.If that all sounds a bit too serious for the man who has redefined the Super Hero genre, rest assured thrill seekers, Inception is also a loud swirly spectacle. The action is raucous, be it gun fights or zero gravity punch ups, Nolan has not lost the ability to take the viewer on an action fuelled roller-coaster ride, aided superbly by Lee Smith's editing and Pfister's perfectly broad photography While Zimmer's score blends electronic action pulse beats with saddened guitar strains (ex-Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr on 12 string) to craft one of the best scores of 2010. As I said, there's something for everyone here, making it perhaps one of the leading nominees for title of ultimate modern day blockbuster.Then there's the strong ensemble cast, led by a quite scintillating performance from DiCaprio. Following on from his cards played close to his chest turn in Shutter Island, DiCaprio has given 2010 two of its best lead performances. Here he gives real depth of emotion, the kind that makes it easy for the viewers to hang their hats on. His unfussy acting is easy to buy into, giving the character the air of believability, he is the glue that binds the whole film together. Murphy is wonderfully vulnerable, very much an axis in the narrative, while Levitt almost usurps DiCaprio with a neatly layered portrayal that carries a delightful whiff of duality about it. Special praise, too, for Ellen Page. Still in her early 20s, she exudes an intelligent sexiness that shines bright in a role that could have been boorishly played as a cipher in a lesser actress' hands. While Hardy provides brawny levity and Berenger leaves a favourable mark.The Matrix meets Heat and Mission Impossible, only it's written by Phillip K. Dick and Richard Matheson; or something like that. A cracking hybrid movie that's fit to grace any summer and sure to improve and enlighten with further viewings. 9.5/10",9/10
Inception (2010),"What do we ask for in a summer blockbuster? What is it that incites hysteria this time every year for whatever dross the studios churn out? Epic hugeness? Blowing stuff up? Romance? Action? Heroes? What are we looking for in a blockbuster? I think it all boils down to thrills! Audiences want the thrill of a car chase, the thrill of romance, the thrill of the spectacular! If that is the case, then Inception just might be the greatest summer blockbuster of all time as it also contains something we often don't look for...brains! ""What is the most resilient parasite? An idea"" says Leonardo Di Caprio's character Cobb. Well, Inception is all about ideas. It's all right there in the title. The film central idea revolves around ""Extractors"", who are paid to extract secrets from people's subconscious minds by sneaking into their dreams, usually for the purpose of corporate espionage. However, when one client asks them to plant an idea in the mind of their corporate rival, ""Inception"" is born. The less said about this film the better. It is full of ideas and invention and for each set piece I divulge, a piece of the film's genius is weakened. This is a film that cleverly and intricately brings the audience through several planes of existence simultaneously but never allows the viewer to feel lost. Such is the power of Christopher Nolan's script which, I imagine, is likely to get overlooked due to the sheer visual magnificence of his direction. But everything that makes this film so great is in the script...in the ideas! Everything else is just spectacle. This film bears an uncanny resemblance, thematically, with DiCaprio's other instant classic this year, Shutter Island. Both films investigate in depth the tricks a traumatised mind can play on the individual. Both films are luscious to watch and both films keep the audience firmly outside the realm of reality. However, Inception is an even more layered film than Shutter Island and I believe the sci-fi genre setting will prove to be less alienating for audiences than the prison noir of Scorsese's film. There is not a single dull moment in Nolan's film. There is style, charm and intelligence in every frame of the film. Every performance is pitch-perfect with some strong support by Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt particularly who have grown up right before our eyes into undeniable movie stars. Leonardo DiCaprio gives a typically flawless performance as the muddled, grieving man who we never quite trust to be living in the real world. The best part of Inception is the large amount of effects which were done in camera. While the film does make use of CGI, there are some pretty mind-blowing practical effects which are as simple as the camera telling beautiful lies; a rare treat these days. This is a blockbuster that ticks all the boxes; smart, sexy (femme fatale, sexy brainy girl, very beautiful men in very beautiful suits) and magical. Inception is the kind of film that reminds me why cinema will never die. Because anyone who thinks it's OK to watch this film on a laptop or iPad is a fool! This is pure cinema, and proud of it. Not to be missed on the big screen!",10/10
Inception (2010),"If one goes to an art gallery to see a provocative piece, one sees something new each time. That's what true art is. That's why a black light Elvis is not art. This film is certainly a tour de force. It requires engagement at every step. LIke most works of art, it doesn't give it all away. I look forward to seeing this the second or even third time. First of all, the premise is wonderfully engaging. Our consciousness is layered as everyone knows who thinks they have awakened, only to find themselves in another nightmare--then they awaken again. We know that the subconscious by nature is out of our control. There you have a wonderful premise. Now layer that further with people who can flip in and out and use this to their own ends. While confusing, it's exciting. The amazing thing is that the director/writer pulls it off. Every nuance and event is picked precisely for its effectiveness. We have the luxury of watching from one precipice into the abyss. We do care about the people and not just because we want them to succeed. We care about the matrix of the dream levels. Great movie.",10/10
Inception (2010),"Surrealism can appear to be ineffably bizarre, or inquisitively titillating, depending purely on the viewer's intellect. Though the realm of surrealism is highly nebulous and complex, but even a slight attempt at improvisation can sometimes go awry and open a Pandora's Box, making the task highly improbable and nigh impossible. This facet of reality may pose a handicap to the most gifted of the directors, but not to the genius of Christopher Nolan, who not only dabbles with the concept of surrealism, but also ingeniously blends it with the elements of Science Fiction in his latest wonder named Inception. Nolan created a niche for himself a decade back by unleashing a monster of a movie called Memento. He further substantiated his status by conjuring movies like Insomnia, The Prestige, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. His unremitting desire for innovation and uncanny craving to foray into the unexplored realms of imagination deservedly earned him an auteur tag, which gave him the carte blanche that a story-teller like Nolan desperately needs. It's highly apparent that Nolan takes every possible advantage of this liberty while filming Inception. Inception is not only dreamlike, but is a dream in itself and is superior to any other thing conceived on the silver screen. With its entwined layers, the movie for the most part serves as an unfathomable riddle and makes multiple viewing extremely essential. It incredibly does extremely well on both the humanistic as well as the technical fronts. In fact, the balance between human emotions and the elements of Science Fiction is so adequate that it's impossible to separate them. The movie is about a futuristic world where the human mind can be intercepted through dream invasion. Cobb is an expert in the art of extracting information (stealing valuable secrets) from deep within the subconscious in the dream state. His proficiency in extraction is marred by a turmoil that begins with his wife's untimely death. He is forced to live the life of a fugitive away from his children. His only chance for redemption lies with a Japanese tycoon named Saitu, who wants him to do an inception (planting information into someone's mind). In order to accomplish this unprecedented task, Cobb and his team must overcome a labyrinth of unforeseeable challenges, where even a slight miss could trap them in a perpetual limbo. Any further revelation would be remissness on my part as the plot is filled with such intricacies that even expatiation would be incapable of justifying its profundity. Leonardo Dicaprio gives a solid performance in the lead role, following his memorable performance in Shutter Island. He has brilliantly depicted the complexities and limitations of Cobb's enigmatic character highlighting his pain and mental trauma. Marion Cotillard is ravishingly scintillating as Cobb's whimsical wife, Mal. The rest of the cast has given a thorough performance with special mention of Ken Watanabe, Ellen Page and Joseph Gordon-Levitt.Inception is incredibly brilliant as a movie and is a breakthrough in contemporary cinema. Nolan's creativity and his unparalleled execution definitely make it an object of great cachet, but whether it would become Buñuel's 'Un chien andalou' or Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' and serve as a prototype for the movies to come is for the time to decide. Irrespectively, Inception is sine qua non not only for an aficionado, but also for the average viewer, who is willing to delve deep enough to savour the delight.PS: One has to imagine it to believe it. 9/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/",9/10
Inception (2010),"Dom Cobb leads a highly skilled team, specializing in stealing secrets from people's minds by entering their dreams. When they are hired by a mysterious businessman, Cobb finally has a shot at redemption, but not before achieving the near impossible. Rather than stealing an idea, they must do the complete opposite: Inception. Planting the seed of an idea.Inception has a multi-layered plot, quite literally in fact. It focuses on the emotional journey of its lead character, Cobb, but at the same time thrusts the audience into multiple levels of action packed story- telling, very distinct from one another, but all finely connected. It has been described by critics as ""a film that rewards intellect"", and I can assure you that it is exactly that. Director Christopher Nolan challenges the audience to keep up, and rewards those who can with a breathtaking spectacle, one that has the capability to leave you awestruck. The best part about it is that while you may feel you need to watch it again to be able to fully absorb the experience, chances are, you will probably want to.Christopher Nolan brings his unique vision to the screen with the help of a star-studded cast, including the likes of Leonardo Dicaprio (The Departed), Joseph Gordon-Levitt (500 Days Of Summer), Ellen Page (Juno), Marion Cotillard (Public Enemies), Cillian Murphy (Batman Begins), and Michael Caine (The Dark Knight), as well some amazing photography by long time collaborator Wally Pfister. The thrilling music in the film is provided by none other than Hans Zimmer, who was also set the mood for Nolan's previous film, The Dark Knight.While it may seem simple at its outset, Inception is an extremely complex film, delving deep into the subconscious of the human mind. Technical brilliance and visual splendor have rarely blended together as beautifully. The emotional depth and explosive action complement each other perfectly, delivering a film that is at the same time both heart- wrenching and heart-pounding. It's a film that manages to engross you with its complexities, yet comes together seamlessly, and will have you at the edge of your seat, quite literally from start to finish.Inception is magnificent.",10/10
Inception (2010),"I'll be the first one to admit that INCEPTION is the kind of thinking man's thriller that has something going on every second of its two-hour and 28 minute running time. But only director Chris Nolan knows what it's all about and I don't believe I'll find out all the explanations until I get the DVD commentary.It's a heady mixture of sci-fi, comic book stuff and fantasy and all of it is focused on the mastery of dream invasion in order to gather secrets held in the human mind. Foremost among the players is LEONARDO DiCAPRIO, playing his role in a very authoritative manner with no shortage of barking orders and furrowed brow, all highly intense, as he gathers a team around him to investigate the dreamscape.There's plenty of action along the way, interspersed with quieter moments of explanatory dialog so the audience has at least some semblance of what's going on. But the whole concept of the story lacks the kind of credibility that would have made the film more engaging than it really is.Credit the actors with doing their best despite the fact that none of them have roles that are fully fleshed out. And this includes Joseph GORDON-LEVITT, ELLEN PAGE, TOM HARDY, CILLIAN MURPHY, KEN WATANABE and TOM BERENGER.If you're a MATRIX fan, you'll love this one. If not, you may wonder what all the fuss was about.Frankly, I had more fun exploring dream invasion in NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, less intellectual but a lot more fun.",6/10
Inception (2010),"The film is a disappointment, because it did so little with so much. Basically what you have here is a very interesting sci-fi heist premise; Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) are partners who use dream-invasion technology to steal industrial secrets from unsuspecting mass transit passengers (why any powerful people in such a technological age would travel on mass transit, is just one of the many obvious questions the film expects us not to raise) while they doze. In exchange for immunity to a troubling criminal charge against Cobb, they agree to undertake an unprecedented mission: to practice ""inception"" on a powerful business scion, that is to plant an original idea in his subconscious through the dream manipulation.All of this is great, but unfortunately none of it has any emotional weight. To find that we have to look into the mystery of why Cobb has been in exile, and this plot has to do with his wife (Marion Cotillard) with whom he shared a disastrous and traumatic experience of dream sharing. This is to me where the movie essentially falls apart. It seems like Nolan and the other writers never fully synthesized these two dominant strains in the film, so that most of the time the emotional drama is just getting in the way of the heist film or vice a versa. At no point did it seem to me that the heist was complimenting the drama or vice a versa. And in fact after some very impressive effects sequences during the scenes where Cobb shows his new assistant Ariadne (Ellen Page, too green to hold up her role) a lot of the action becomes outright tedious, never more so than when we're ""treated"" to about a reel or ten minutes of numbing snow-mobile and gunfight action, right at the point where the film should be reaching a climax. It all starts to feel very obligatory, and Nolan is not a good enough action director to make empty content feel like fun.As a basic action/heist movie with sci-fi premise, it still works well enough that I would recommend it as a rental. Nolan works in some of the elements that have made some of his better films work on a higher level, such as the association with totems and icons (the spinning wheel, etc.) and the connection between memory or memory devices and identity. However when all the pieces are laid out, the film seems overly simple and mechanical. The plot is just this -- the guy takes a job, he does the job, he gets to re-unite with his kids. Although he constantly mopes about in a depression because he tried inception on his wife and she died, he has no ethical or moral problem with doing the same thing to Cillian Murphy's character, even though nobody knows the real consequences that could befall or the true motives of Ken Watanabe's character. I was hoping that some larger picture would emerge, but instead this film is politically naive and instead attempts to be dramatic. The constant shots of adorable children playing on the lawn made me feel I was watching a bad Spielberg film. The entire emotional anchor of the film is put on the shoulders of these cute kiddies in true Spielberg fashion. If you don't buy into this ridiculous soft-target hook, then the whole film collapses like DiCaprio's dream world.This isn't a bad or stupid film, but after a while you start to yearn for at least some human warmth or humor, which is almost always missing from Nolan's films. The characters are so sincere that it starts to become suffocating, especially considering how ridiculous the premise is when taken seriously. Basically this is like ""Total Recall"" in terms of ideas and in terms of stupid action scenes, except that it takes itself hugely seriously. It does not become a better film by doing so, nor a more intelligent one.",6/10
Inception (2010),"The central idea of ""Inception"" is an interesting one: technology exists to enter other people's dreams in order to steal their most private secrets or to implant new ideas. With Christopher Nolan of ""Memento"" fame as writer and director, this should have been a smart, compelling movie. Unfortunately, ""Inception"" is a bloated failure.The root problem is that Nolan replaces the fascinating surrealism of dream worlds with lengthy outtakes from James Bond movies. For example, early in the film, when Cobb and Ariadne are sitting at a café in a dream world, Cobb tells Ariadne to stay calm. What's going to happen? Is the waiter going to bring her a glass full of wriggling eyeballs? Is she going to turn around and see her best friend from high school having sex with Abraham Lincoln? No. THINGS START EXPLODING. And that's the whole movie in a nutshell: gaudy special effects and endless fight scenes as a poor substitute for imaginative ideas.The matryoshka-doll plot of dreams within dreams isn't nearly as hard to follow as one might imagine. This is largely because nothing of consequence happens at higher levels once our heroes have moved on to deeper levels. The higher-level supporting actors just fight off bad guys -- and overblown special effects -- until it's time to bring back their colleagues from the depths.Nolan should sit back, watch a few of the best movies by Luis Bunuel and David Lynch, and try again with one-tenth the budget and ten times the imagination. (Okay, that's never gonna happen, but it's *my* dream.)",5/10
Inception (2010),"I have been reading nothing but good reviews on Inception these past few weeks, now I knew from the minute I saw the trailer, I had to see this movie but I didn't know what to expect. If you have seen the trailer to this movie, you know that it doesn't explain too much. But I saw Inception today and all I can say is: Wow! With an incredible cast and amazing director, you just can't go wrong. Inception is a movie that not only makes you think but can start a whole conversation with what you just saw on the screen. It's a very clever story that is told with skill and passion, while you do have to pay attention, I loved that it made me think. One of my friends saw a premiere and told me how he would have to see it again to understand it, but I didn't get that when I saw it today. But I would love to see the movie again, I have no problem with that. Between the performances, the story, the sounds, the editing and the incredible effects, I would love to watch this movie over and over again, it's my favorite film of the year so far.Dom Cobb is a skilled thief, the absolute best in the dangerous art of extraction, stealing valuable secrets from deep within the subconscious during the dream state, when the mind is at its most vulnerable. Cobbs rare ability has made him a coveted player in this treacherous new world of corporate espionage, but it has also made him an international fugitive and cost him everything he has ever loved. Now Cobb is being offered a chance at redemption. One last job could give him his life back but only if he can accomplish the impossible inception. He gathers a group of thieves that will pull this incredible mission off, teaching new comer, Ariadne their amazing world and how to alter it to their liking, but if gone too deep into making the dream into something strange, they could get lost and play limbo between reality and dreams. Even after all the lessons, instead of the perfect heist, Cobb and his team of specialists have to pull off the reverse: their task is not to steal an idea but to plant one.To write a dream is a riddle, I love the way this movie was written. Christopher Nolan is one of my new favorite directors, he knows exactly how to write and tell a story. The only small flaw, this is a very small complaint, is that his stories while they're incredible, can also be a bit exhausting. This film is a bit long to warn you in advance, it's a little over two and a half hours long. I felt like there were a couple of things with the story that could have been trimmed, but like I said it's such a small complaint because Inception intrigued me so much. To say that this film will be a contender for the Oscars is pretty much a guarantee with the sound, script, editing and effects. Hopefully I think it might be a runner up for best picture.One of the things I hate to do in a review is brag about a movie because I don't want others to get over hyped with the film and to be disappointed when they see it. But honestly, I don't think there isn't one person I wouldn't recommend this movie too. Inception has some of the most incredible effects mixing The Matrix and The Dark Knight, I think the ""Zero Gravity"" fight scene is one of the most amazing moments I've seen on the big screen. I loved how the story kept you thinking and going, guessing what would happen next and what was going on. A dream within a dream within a dream, you even begin to question with the characters what is a dream and what is reality. With a great cast and excellent director, Inception is everything I wanted and more, once again, Nolan created a masterpiece. Something from his own mind, Inception questions yours' and makes you wonder which world you are part of.10/10",10/10
Inception (2010),"Usually I try to be careful with over hyping a film, or setting the expectations too high, as film geeks all are guilty for, however for Christopher Nolan's Inception, this really is not possible.This is possibly one of the only perfect films I have ever seen. It is absolutely confident in every way, something which is extremely refreshing, even more so than Avatar. Christopher Nolan gets some slack for making great to look at but ultimately heartless affairs, which I for one do not agree with, however I do not think anyone can argue that here. The emotional aspect of this film not only ties it all together but is really the centre of this film, it is the focus. I do not want to over simplify the film, by simply calling it Kubrick doing Bond, or Gondry on a huge budget, because I am sure it will be called that but it is far more than that, it is something I do not think Kubrick could have ever made. It is pure Nolan, and pure greatness.I hate writing something which is pure fan-boy gushing, but its really difficult here. I did not find a thing I did not like about it, I am sure if maybe I saw it a second time, maybe I would find something about it I didn't like, but not the first time. The way it is cut, means that there is always action on screen, if not, then the visuals are interesting enough to keep your eyes glued.The final hour of the film, is possibly one of the most complicated action sequences put on film. You have to constantly be paying attention to remember all of the layers of what is happening. Without spoiling anything, all I have to say is that is what this film is about, that is what makes this film so great, layers. Once you have seen this you will now what I am talking about.All of the actors are fantastic too, Di Caprio is the stand out here. Yes, this is probably due to the fact he is the star and given all of the emotional weight, but he handles it perfectly, similarly to his performance in Shutter Island. Ellen Page, whom I usually hate, gives a great performance here. Tom Hardy gives a break out performance here, he is quite the bad ass.I hope audiences are ready for a film like this, a pure auteur driven film which does not sacrifice a single frame for the studio. I would hope this film will change Hollywood, as it is 100 percent the directors vision yet it is definitely a marketable film, much like District 9, yet I do not think it will. I cannot recommend this film anymore than I have, I just have to say everyone and anyone should see it. Sorry about all the gushing, it is just so hard not too.If you liked this review check out my new film blog: http://thedeletedscene.wordpress.com",10/10
Inception (2010),"I have to say to make such an impressive trailer and such an uninteresting film, takes some doing.Here you have most of the elements that would make a very good film. You have great special effects, a sci-fi conundrum, beautiful visuals and good sound. Yet the most important part of the film is missing. There is no plot, character or soul to this film. It's like having a beautiful building on the outside with no paint or decoration on the inside.It's an empty shell of a film. There is no tension; you couldn't care less about any of the characters, why were they even motivated to do what they did. Helping a corporation get ""one over"" on another corporation is hardly saving the human race.When you operate in a dream environment, where you can't die or be injured really it means there is nothing to worry about, who cares what happens. All the explosions and actions sequences are just meaningless. By the way, why does Hollywood still keep filming action scene's an inch away from every characters nose? It's impossible to see what's going on, so many films are ruined by this. Watch and learn from the Matrix, take the camera backwards a couple of feet and we can actually work out what's going on.So 2 and half hours of looking at my watch waiting for the very predictable ending, is a million miles from being a good film. How anyone in their right mind can give this 10/10, it's boring and pointless. A film has stir the soul, has to grab you, you need to feel for the characters. Can anyone, honestly say, they cared about anyone on show here.By the way, here's an idea, why don't you bring the children (who haven't aged a minutes since you last saw them) to you, if you can't go to the US.I know the end scene was trying to be ambiguous, but the fact his father, who lives in Paris, is bizarrely there in the US to meet him (how did he know) and the children look identical to every dream sequence they appeared in, means there wasn't much doubt.In the end there is nothing at stake for anyone, so a pointless movie. I suspect Nolan will continue to get praise, but I can't really say I've got excited about any of his movies. They all leave me cold. They are not terrible, just there's nothing really there, no substance.",1/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"After most entries in Phase 4 passed by without doing much to set up the next big bad in the MCU, I was eagerly anticipating this film given it would be the big screen introduction of Kang. While Majors shines as Kang, the rest of the film and even some of the narrative choices with Kang leave a bit of a ""meh"" feeling.As far as positives, Paul Rudd remains as endearing as ever. MODOK is a tad jarring, but I liked the tie-in to Yellowjacket. The visuals are solid and it's a very colorful movie. Majors truly has a magnetic presence on screen and I found his dialogues and conversations to be very compelling.For negatives, there aren't really any arcs for the characters and Ant-Man himself ends up in literally the same place (on the sidewalk thinking about how good his life is) as the beginning of the film. Scott's cohorts aren't given much to do either. The MCU hallmark of jokes undercutting serious moments unfortunately continues and honestly the comedy really didn't land as well as the first two films. I also got major Rise of Skywalker vibes with the cliche ""everyone in the rebellion shows up to fight the space troopers at the end.""However, my big issue with the film is the ending. This movie felt like it should've had some major consequences to establish Kang as an Avengers-level threat. Having Scott and Hope dispatch him while a portal opens up to save them literally seconds after you thought they might get trapped in the Quantum Realm or Kang would escape was eyeroll-inducing. The Council of Kangs scene was also almost more goofy than menacing.I'm hopeful that Feige can right the ship and get the Multiverse Saga to Infinity Saga levels of hype, but right now I'm just left not feeling much. I never thought I'd say this, but I think I'm currently looking forward more to seeing how The Flash movie resets the DCU than how the MCU multiverse plays out.",6/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"Well, I'll start off by saying that this wasn't a bad movie. It wasn't great, but it was alright. It was like Dune and Star Wars had a baby, and I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Jonathan Majors definitely stole the show here. We will be seeing a lot more of him. Literally.The CGI was very rough in places, and the editing was very off at times. It could have used an extra few months in development. At that, Modok was atrocious in execution.That's just how Marvel has been lately. Quantity over quality, unfortunately.Another thing I will say: I wish a Marvel movie would take itself seriously once in a while. The humor gets repetitive.7/10 for me.",7/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"As a huge fan of the first one, and almost as big a fan of the second one, I decided to go all out and see this one in 3D with the 4DX motion and sensory seats. What a let down; sure, sitting in the nicest seats for the best visual, motion and sensory experience was great, but I felt like I was watching a Looney Tunes story, instead of any type of story that is part, or compliments the MCU timeline. This was literally one of Marvel's dullest and most unnecessary movies to date. The entire story was cliched and predictable, and there was more CGI than there was any type of interesting story, let alone one with any substance. Even the normally awesome and hilarious humor in the previous installments was absent in this one. Almost the entire film is taking place inside a CGI story, so there was no need for any movie sets or locations... this was all green-screen nonsense. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, only because I still enjoyed the fun ride in my upgraded seats, although the money spent would've been more fun at an amusement park.",6/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"New Ant-Man is not a bad movie, but it's repeating current trend that been plaguing new Marvel productions. Main character is just an excuse to introduce few new characters that are definitely going to have their own stories. That makes Paul Rudd's character less important. You don't feel that this is his story. He is just there. And the story is not even that good. You can feel the lack of great characters from previous movies. They were setting the tone of story and we don't even know what happened to them after previous movie. It's hard to believe that the director is the same person who made two prior movies. Adding Kang definitely made this into Kang movie that have Ant-Man in it.",6/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"I enjoyed watching Quantumania. It's a mostly solid and fairly entertaining movie. But relative to MCU standards, it's a bit underwhelming and feels like more of a throwaway movie than something memorable I will keep coming back to.My biggest issue is that I wasn't fully engaged for at least the first half of the movie. I was enjoying it but I wasn't locked in. The story was unfocussed. When the villain becomes prevalent, the movie jumps a level. But it doesn't completely make up for the much weaker first half.The other thing that surprised me was not being mesmerized by the visuals. It's very creative and I didn't notice poor CGI like some others. But it didn't wow me like it frequently does. Maybe we're just getting spoiled with the visuals in movies like Doctor Strange 2 and more recently Avatar 2.There is still a lot of good here. It's pretty funny but doesn't overdo it. This is the second movie in a row where the MCU seems to have dialed back on the ""insert joke here"" strategy. It's probably a result of the negative reaction from the cartoonish Thor 4. Also, I love the villain. I won't say who in case you're smart and don't watch trailers like me. But he's so damn awesome.As someone who loves almost everything in the MCU, Quantumania is near the bottom of my MCU rankings. And it's making me a little nervous that it comes only two movies after Thor 4 which is below it (5 stars). But I still have faith and am not fatigued. Phase 4 has three of my favorite entries in the entire MCU (Shang-Chi, Loki S01, No Way Home) and I only disliked two (Eternals, Thor 4). They just need to be more consistent while also not playing it so safe. (1 viewing, opening Thursday IMAX 2/16/2023)",6/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" is the first film of Phase 5 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Once again directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd and Evangeline Lilly in the title roles, it ranks among the MCU's weakest efforts in its execution of both fun and emotional payoffs.Some time after the events of ""Avengers: Endgame"", Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is enjoying being in the spotlight with the recent publication of his autobiography. While Scott is hanging out with Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly), her parents Hank (Michael Douglas) and Janet (Michelle Pfieffer), and Scott's daughter Cassie (Kathryn Newton), the group are accidentally sucked into the Quantum Realm, where they each discover it is not as destitute as they had initially thought. Soon, the group learn of a dangerous new threat inhabiting the Realm known as Kang the Conqueror (Jonathan Majors), who will stop at nothing to escape his fate as a prisoner of this place. As Kang makes his position clear, it is up to Scott and the others to stop Kang before irreversible damage is inflicted on all of space and time.Right now, it seems the MCU is in a strange holding pattern after ""Avengers: Endgame"". Although there have been several films and TV shows made since then, there hasn't really been any concrete indication of what to expect from where the series is heading. This is because even after all these years, we haven't had any proper build-up to whom the main villain will be that is taking over from Thanos. While ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" at least establishes some things to look forward to in the future, it never does so in a way that can distinguish itself as nothing more than a relatively mediocre entry in this already expansive cinematic universe.Given that this film is supposed to kick off Phase 5, it surprises me how few exciting moments there were to hype up the audience. The previous two ""Ant-Man"" films contain some of the funniest, most entertaining scenes that fans like myself have come to appreciate from the MCU after all these years. Yet here, I struggled to find anything remotely enjoyable that could leave an impression on the viewer. Aside from the odd dry banter from Scott, there are no amusing scenes of comic relief to alleviate the severity of whenever something bad has taken place. Most other MCU films have been able to strike a balance between humorous and dramatic but this one leans so heavily on its dark tone that it is simply not fun to watch at times. If the filmmakers wanted make a darker ""Ant-Man"" film, that's fine, but this is not the way they should have gone about it.Another big problem is that the film goes way too far with its overuse of CGI. Though the MCU has used plenty of CGI in prior films, they at least tried to make it look like it had some basis in reality to give the audience the impression that what was on screen could be imagined as physically right in front of the characters. Here, it is used so much as a means to an end that the whole film looks about as realistic as the Star Wars prequels. At no point did the Quantum Realm ever feel like a real place inhabited by its population of various creatures. Instead, we constantly have to watch the actors move around within the limited confines of what I assume is where green screen stages were in ways that looked so planned out that it doesn't match the vibrant environments they are projected against. Everything looks so clean and sterile that it is near impossible to imagine the characters actually being there in any of these locations. At first, I thought maybe I have just become desensitised to CGI in general but as the visual effects kept piling up here, I found myself becoming less and less invested in the story, which has never happened to me with other MCU entries until now.The cast of the film were fine, considering what they had to work with, but I doubt this will be viewed as them at their best. Paul Rudd still exudes his likeable charm as Scott Lang/Ant-Man, who is now treated like a true hero by the general public. I'll admit it's nice to see an underdog like Scott finally get the recognition he deserves after all this time, especially considering the important part he played in helping the Avengers bring back half of the universe's population from Thanos's actions. Scott's best scenes were with his daughter Cassie, with Kathryn Newton now playing the role in place of Emma Fuhrmann. At first, I wasn't sure about the recasting of the character, but Newton proved she was right for the part. Some of the physical requirements for the character seemed to come naturally for Newton and she also had pretty good chemistry with Rudd as her onscreen father.I was somewhat underwhelmed by how Evangeline Lilly, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Michael Douglas were used this time around. For a film that has ""Ant-Man and the Wasp"" in its title, we don't really see enough of the titular characters doing things together. Instead, Hope mainly hangs around with her parents, and while this does provide some decent scenes of the three bonding together, it still seems like a strange creative decision to keep her separate from Scott for so long. Additionally, Douglas and Pfeiffer, while not exactly going to waste, didn't contribute as much to story as I had hoped. If it weren't for one crucial scene near the end, I'd say that Hank and Janet's presence in the film was quite forgettable. Most of the time I kept forgetting about them as I cared more about what was happening with Scott and Cassie in the meantime.However, the one character that stood out the most to me was Kang the Conqueror, played by a surprisingly intimidating Jonathan Majors. Anybody who watched the first season of the Disney+ series ""Loki"" will remember this character, who was known back then as ""He Who Remains"". This time, we get a better look at Kang's motivations as a villain and why he is so determined to inflict chaos on all the different multiverses. Majors does a good job at concealing Kang's true personality, whose vulnerability is used as a facade for his malicious intent. I guess I liked watching Kang the most because he is the only character in the film with some kind of interesting end goal, while all the others are only there to try and stop him. I'm looking forward to seeing more of Kang in future MCU projects, as I think he has the potential to be as threatening as Thanos was back in the Infinity Saga.For the beginning of a new chapter in the MCU, ""Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania"" just doesn't land in the same way as the previous films. It tries hard to be one of the darker entries in the series by upping the ante with its main villain but it ends up relying too much on the audience's assumption that things will be addressed in more detail later on. At this point, I can only hope that ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"", the next film in the MCU release schedule, will leave a better impression on me and other long time fans because if that doesn't work, we're in for a relatively dull Phase 5.I rate it 6/10.",6/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"Marvel really has fallen and it can't get up. This is the third legacy character that they've absolutely wasted. In fact, for Doctor Strange, Thor and Ant-Man they not only wasted great established characters but superb casts. Add that they made Kang, the main villain out to be a chump and it appears Marvel has no plan moving forward. Not Kiang the conqueror but Kang the chump.This movie adds to the malaise of poorly written disappointments that is permeated the MCU since Endgame. With one of the worst third acts of any movie in recent history. MODOK use and ""dick"" turn could be the dumbest thing I've ever seen and that's not even a spoiler. He also ended the movie as if they ran out of budget. What an absolute waste.",6/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"Ant-Man's 3rd solo outting. Doubling down on the sci-fi elements of the MCU. Overall the humor was like the rest of the previous movies. The cast was all stellar. Doesn't really dive that deep into Kang's story, but what we did get was sufficient. Johnathan Majors portrayal was excellent, just wish he had more substance to work with. The visual effects were definitely spotty. Blue screen overload, wish they took more time blending in the effects with with actors. This leads into Modok, as a concept. I didn't mind his backstop changing, just wish they went more practical with his design. Overall Quantumania was a pretty fun movie, but for setting the tone of ""PHASE 5"", Marvel will definitely need to step up their storytelling, and start getting more into detail with these characters, and concepts.",7/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"It was different than the 2 previous that's true but people wanted more dark marvel projects so here it is. The performances of Michelle Pffiefer and Jonathan Majors were great and the action scenes were cool. The Cgi and dialogue were a little meh somwtimes.. In genaral, it had a good story but it needed to go deeper into the wasp's character, She had less scenes than the other movies. Cassie's character seemed good but with a better script she would be better. Whoever stayed for the credit scenes did good, cause they kinda add some points to the movie. People need to accept the difference between funny and dark and marvel needs to be careful for the Cgi stuff.!",8/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"I may have enjoyed this a bit more than others mainly because my expectations were incredibly low. I was treating it just another average superhero comic movie and also Paul Rudd was great.Nothing innovative was really done to the story itself. It had the same cookie cutter plot, nothing we haven't seen before overall.On top of the bland story, the CGI for certain scenes were bad. I watched this in IMAX and some sequences would get blurry and just chalky or some scenes would have laughably ugly CGI for which Marvel
should be blamed because we have seen in the past that they are able to really create beautiful set pieces with a mix of CGI and practical effects(like End Game)Some of the characters in the film were also there to probably just create a subplot of some kind so there can be a bit of back and forth but it didn't really have any sort of major impact nor did it make me care about these side charactersIn the end this was very average at best, though it is suppose to setup Phase 5 for marvel, it definitely didn't feel like it.",6/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"Where do I even begin? They somehow made a movie that's even worse and more uninteresting than the second Ant-Man movie. I haven't been this uninvested in an MCU movie since Thor 4 and Captain Marvel. Like another reviewer said, who even cares anymore?First of all, the first act of this movie is probably the worst first act of any MCU movie I've seen in a while. It's also artificially made boring and uninteresting because they do this stupidest trope of one character hiding something from the others and not telling them until the middle of the movie and their explanation for it is ""I wanted to protect you"". Protect her from what? An angry guy with the size of an atom in the Quantum Realm? Not telling your family of ""scientists"" about the actual dangers of Quantum Realm and then getting mad when they eff with it is protecting them? I hate this trope so much because there's no point to it. The only reason they did that was to postpone introducing Kang and showing his flashbacks till the second act.The first act is completely boring but it gets just a little better and more interesting when they introduce Kang. But the movie gets boring and uninteresting as it goes anyway.There is no character arc in this movie. Marvel, or rather the writers they hire have forgotten how to write scripts anymore. They don't even care enough to have character arcs, so it's no surprise they don't do any characterization for the new characters either.Remember the first Doctor Strange movie? Remember his memorable character arc throughout his first movie? Remember when MCU writers had an iota of an idea of how to write a movie and make the audience actually care about the characters and have interesting characters? Remember when they actually tried? Now compare that to the second Doctor Strange movie where he doesn't even feel like the main character of his own movie, now imagine something that's somehow even worse and you get this movie.I don't even know who's the main character of this movie. Scott Lang doesn't have a character arc in this movie. Her daughter wants to help the resistance people for some reason and Lang who is the ""hero"" apparently, doesn't care and doesn't even change at the end. Things just happen and they go through it and that's that, no character growth and no nothing.They for some reason again mislead us in the trailers that Scott wants to help Kang because he missed Cassie's childhood. But this is nowhere to be found in the actual movie. Now I know about Marvel trailers and that they have misleading footage and stuff that aren't in the movie, but they aren't usually as misleading as this one. And the funny thing is, this could've worked better than whatever cliché we got in the actual film.Also, what's with the kid genius trope we keep seeing in these movies? Why does every child of these superheroes have to be a genius scientist and inventor all of a sudden? Can't they be a normal child with normal lives for once? All of them have to invent some multiverse-bending device in their garage that even Tony Stark couldn't've made?And speaking of the resistance people, please show me someone who actually watched this movie and cared about them or even remembers their names. The writers don't even do the bare minimum of characterizing them. You won't care about these people or their uprising and revolution when watching this movie. You won't care about any of them dying.This movie was only made to introduce Kang and nothing else. The writers don't care about characterization or character arcs or even writing a decent plot with what they've got. Why even make this movie when we had Kang introduced in Loki? This adds nothing and is repetitive. You don't even need to see this movie if you have seen Loki. Somehow Loki gave more backstory and characterization to this next big baddie of the MCU than this movie, and he was only in the last episode of that show, so you go figure!It's obvious that they saw the backlash and mediocre reactions to Phase 4 and decided to make Kang the villain of this movie and start Phase 5 with this to set him up as the next big villain and hype people up again, and they failed miserably at that.MODOK's design and CGI are somehow even worse than the floating head in Thor 4. It's probably the goofiest and worst thing I've seen in a while, and his character doesn't even have a place in this movie. The design of his armor when he's not showing his face is alright, but my god what an atrocious monstrosity! I don't even know what they were thinking designing him like that. Even Marvel's Avengers game had a better design than this, and that game had the blandest and forgettable face designs ever. And the only reason he was in this movie was to have something connected to the first Ant-Man movie. He doesn't serve a purpose in this movie and they even dare thinking we would care about him.Speaking of the first Ant-Man movie, that movie at least knew how to be a little fun movie about Scott Lang and a reasonable throwaway villain, not a giant world-ending event with a big baddie that's out of Ant-Man's league. If you've seen The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes, you know that all the Avengers combined can't even defeat Kang, but here we are with Ant-Man and the Wasp and his daughter saving the world from this omnipotent god. And this omnipotent god has robot soldiers that somehow die from a paintball bullet. This is why it's tricky to have a villain that's omnipotent, because you make it harder for the audience to believe that he would be this dumb to have prison cells that can be opened if you stick a fork into their control panels and robots that die from a punch and him getting defeated at the end somehow.And this is one of the biggest reasons Phase 4, and apparently Phase 5 now have been a huge disappointment for me, especially for the Dinsey Plus shows; the fact that each and every one of them has to end with a huge gigantic clusterfk of an ending and third act, with two Kaijus punching each other. Shang-Chi that's about this father and son? End it with a big fight in the third act with a giant Dragon. Moon Knight which is a street-level superhero? End it with two Kaijus punching each other. Black Widow? Some CGI vomit of bad action in the sky or something. Eternals? Same Kaiju fighting. Same with What If and Ms. Marvel. Just have a big battle or even a full-on war like Wakanda Forever in your third act. Just have ""world-ending"" ""stakes"" in each and every project of yours, doesn't matter how big or small the superhero is. I think pretty much most of the audience apart from the Marvel fanboys have gotten tired of this formula since a long time ago, I don't understand how the producers and writers haven't yet.This movie is also CGI galore and I don't think there was even one real set. The actors probably still never met each other and all of them were shot separately.I also remember when they said Ant-Man couldn't take his mask off if he's small or big, but here we are having him enlarged to the size of Kong and having his helmet off easily like it's nothing. There's no difference in pressure on his body and his head when he's large and takes his helmet off. So what's even the point of having a helmet in the first place? Just stab yourself with one of those blue enlargement pills ;) and get big or small.I have rambled a lot, but the more I write, the more I realize I don't care about this movie and it's probably better to stop wasting more time on it and move on.All in all, this movie is a big disappointment and fails at pretty much everything it does or tries to do. There is no characterization or character arc, there is no real tension and you won't care about anything and anybody because they don't take time to develop characters, the movie is full of tropes and clichés and all in a bad way, Kang has a better introduction in Loki, the movie is all CGI and action and is somehow on par with Eternals on how boring and uninteresting it is.The M(id)CU continues to be mid and they are progressively getting worse with writing actual decent plots, characters, and villains, and I don't think most people care anymore about what the next MCU movie is gonna be about (apart from GOTG3) and which version of Kang we're gonna see next. The hype and excitement and investment people had MCU has significantly died down since Endgame and I don't think most people now care about what's coming in the future.I don't even have a morsel of hope in what they're gonna do with the X-Men, Blade, Daredevil, and Fantastic Four. If they can't even think of a good story to tell for Ant-Man and Wasp and they just throw the next big baddie in there to fight, they probably will have ran out of ideas by the time they're gonna make X-Men.",4/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"All I have to say is rotten tomatoes gave this the same score as eternals(47%) and this is hands down much more entertaining than that crappy movie. Is this the best marvel movie ever? No. But is definitely a good popcorn movie, has great graphics and is a blast to watch In the theatres. Majors as Kang is great, MODOK IS A FUN character as well. This film brings real eye candy to viewers and I can guarantee any fan of The MCU is gonna like this movie. We need to stop being so critical of these movies as they are made strictly to be entertaining and this movie succeeds in that in every way. No as funny as previous ant man's but still has some funny moments.",8/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"Quantum Mania takes the MCU deeper into the quantum realm and presents us a real first taste of Kang the Conqueror. Thanos and his Infinity War are now part of the past in a timeline that has been upended by the discovery of the multiverse. The hype surrounding Ant-Man and the Wasp 2(?) seemed impossible to meet. The same weight was put on the Multiverse of Madness which cracked under the pressure of expectation. Unfortunately, QuantumMania suffers the same fate. Kang is intimidating, powerful and compelling but has been muzzled and restrained by a screenplay that lacks courage and risk when it mattered. Majors is fantastic as the character and I can't wait to see him develop this character and other variants further. However, I can't help but see a missed opportunity here to plant Kang like a unavoidable tree in the multiverse saga. It feels like Marvel prefers to put all their eggs in the basket of Loki season 2 rather than a feature film.It's not all bad though. On the contrary. The film is often times charming, engaging and genuinely funny. It has some fantastic set pieces with inconsistent CGI which has become the new norm for Marvel as of late. Our main cast of characters are solid, though I can't help but feel Hope has been left by the wayside here. Quantum Mania is a solid entry in the MCU but lacks any weight to be memorable or revolutionary. It had a great opportunity to shock and surprise but chose to play it safe and missed out on some great potential.",7/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"I looked forward to Kang joining the Antman trilogy and I was very excited what they are going to make with him, so I went to the first possible screening of the movie and yup it wasn't good...So to start with good things, Jonathan Majors was great as Kang. He is just a talented actor just as Micheal Douglas as Hank Pym. But that's pretty much it...The movie feels like a cheap and bad copy/mix of Ready Player One and Guardians of the Galaxy 2, and I am a person who loves both of the movies. The movie introduces us a character, who we know (I won't spoil who), in a new form which makes this character with high potential to a ridiculous character about we only laugh! I mean, common Marvel, you don't have to make everything a joke.So if you ask me if the movie is better then the first two? Definitely not.",5/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"I like Paul Rudd. I think he's naturally charming and really funny. I really wanted for this Ant-Man to do well, as the other 2 were just okay, and didn't do well in the box office either. Unfortunately this isn't the hit movie that changes things for Ant-Man or Marvel. It has some good moments, and cool visuals. However if you look a little deeper, a lot of things stand out. Like the fact that they were harvesting quantum energy from the quantum realm in the post credits of the last movie, yet Janet didn't seem concerned, even though she is very worried about the quantum realm, which they show in the trailer, so it's not something you'd only gather from watching the movie. Her backstory was kept quiet because they hadn't thought of it yet. Usually they keep things open for other Marvel movies, but this story felt very tacked on for the sake of this movie. Hope had some moments, but very little dialogue. Also, I thought I dozed off, as this movie seemed to jump from a long first act, to the third act. Jonathan Majors (Kang) does all the heavy lifting in this movie. His story, and his motivations seem the most developed. I wouldn't call this a bad movie, but they didn't knock it out of the park, by any means. It seems like Marvel has been in this post-Endgame slump that they haven't been able to break out of.",6/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"Convinced marvel movies are just being written by ChatGPT. Kang somehow destroyed multiple versions of the avengers and timelines but gets defeated by an army of ants? I know he comes back but I cannot be the only one who finds this ridiculous. This is why most people are getting burnt out from the MCU. These movies have no integrity and just cater to the mindlesss fans who watches every single piece of media marvels dishes out. Sorry not sorry. I was actually excited for this movie, but once again this movie is just riddled with witty and snarky humor that it takes away from the precedence story. I don't mind humor, it's just take it feels so out of place it takes out the immersion. Every marvel movie just feels like an SNL skit nowadays. If phase 5 doesn't deliver I'm afraid marvel will fall off.",6/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot. A spin on the Ant-man franchise and for me was a hit! Feels like a contextual vehicle for Kang the Conqueror. Some elements don't quite work. But those are minimal, and I didn't leave the cinema effected negatively by them in any way. Scale is big acting was impressive! Comedy aspect to the franchise still still very alive. It all worked and flowed in a fun weird way. Nothing mind blowing.Synopsis:
Super-Hero partners Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) and Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) return to continue their adventures as Ant-Man and the Wasp. Together, with Hope's parents Janet van Dyne (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), and Scott's daughter Cassie Lang (Kathryn Newton), the family finds themselves exploring the Quantum Realm, interacting with strange new creatures and embarking on an adventure that will push them beyond the limits of what they thought possible.",7/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"Arriving on TV sets in 1977, beloved American comedy series Happy Days aired its now infamous Hollywood: Part 3 episode that was made notable for a scene in which Henry Winkler's Fonzie proceeded to conduct a water-ski stunt involving a jump over a shark, leading to the coining of the phrase ""jumping the shark"" representing a moment where things have gone too far, past the point of no return.A sad moment in 1977 for Happy Days, 31 films into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) it's time we now call it as it is and say that Marvel has now cooked it's golden goose.It can't be denied, Marvel had an incredible run from the moment Iron Man entered the pop culture space in 2008 and for years following the Robert Downey Jr starring hit the comic book behemoth delivered some of the most enjoyable and entertaining big screen spectacles we could've asked for and while they no doubt stuck to a formula many now berate as being the death knell of quality cinema, time and time again Marvel proved to be masters of juggling characters, spectacle and entertainment (often against the odds), culminating in the double pronged attacked of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame that tied off years worth of work in spectacular fashion.From there on out however things have taken a sharp turn towards entering the water, strapping on a set of skis and finding a willing shark to hold position as its launched over with Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania a new low for the modern age Marvel brand name that follows in the not so impressive footsteps of last years misfires Thor: Love and Thunder, Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and the OK if far from memorable Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.Kicking off the championed ""Phase 5"" of the MCU, Quantumania finds Paul Rudd's once charming and likeable every-man Scott Lang have his solo venture hijacked and turned from a fun and carefree heist/comedy of often hilariously tiny proportions into a lifeless and convoluted set-up for what's to come as we enter into yet another alternate universe, quantum realm, 8th dimension and whatever else Marvel wants to conjure up to cover up having to explain things or make much sense in what is a narrative out that has now become part and parcel of their storytelling devices in what started out in a fun fashion but has quickly grown overly wearisome.Forgoing most of the aspects of the Ant-Man brand that was never outstanding to begin with but found fans of many ages on a global scale, Quantumania gives little thought to laying out much groundwork, throwing Lang and his offsiders that includes daughter Cassie, partner The Wasp (poor Evangeline Lilly, getting to share a title but not an ounce of worthy screen-time/character development), in-laws Janet and Hank (equally underused Michelle Pfeiffer and Michael Douglas) into the quantum realm where they come across Jonathan Major's new Thanos level big bad Kang the Conqueror, a character that could offer hope moving forward but gets little if any memorable moments here in an underwritten and uninspired main entrance.Not convinced Quantumania sets the new low standard for the MCU and causes great concern for the ability of the future of the whole shared universe idea? I am sure the CGI'd butt cheeks of how did that pass quality control M. O. D. O. K, a little hole loving alien who utters the phrase ""milk juice"", the site of Douglas strutting into another mindless big city battle with a horde of ants flanking him in what's akin to the worst version of The Charge of Rohirrim you could conjure up or just the general sense that no one cares enough to even pretend will surely do the trick.It's been an incredible run but now all we can do is sit back and watch as the MCU gathers speed and launches itself out of the water for one spectacular if miss judged jump.Final Say -Ladies and gentleman it's time for Thor: The Dark World, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2 and Eternals to move aside, Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is now the worst MCU film yet with all the signs pointing to it likely moving aside itself as the ship it's a part of slowly but surely sinks.1 1/2 over priced coffees out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",7/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"Well it's happened. The MCU has run out of gas. The last few MCU films have been lackluster at best. Not counting the sort of stand alone Spider-Man No Way Home. Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is supposed to start the Phase 5 of this thing and if it goes on like this it's going to get worse!!! This film is of course competently made, looks good and is not horrible but is completely uninspired and like pretty much everything out of the MCE factory since Endgame it's totally forgettable. The reason that the MCU was so successful is that the films had characters we cared about. Stakes were there, of course they were lightoments but there were heroes to root for and some pretty good villains. We cared about what was on the screen. I didn't care at all about what I saw in Quantumania. Not that every film from Iron Man to Endgame was great but they were mostly at least better than average. The two previous Ant-Man films were among the weakest but were still more memorable than this one. The acting in Quantumania is fine but but again no one to really care about. Even Paul Rudd who is usually very engaging us just flat here. He seems to be phoning it in. The only notable performance is Jonathan Majors as Kang the Conqueror but he alone can't save the film from being just painfully average. It's never boring but it's just not exciting or engaging.Just average in an MCU that us just churning out film after film with average results. I think Kevin Feige and company should go back and see what made these films better when the MCU started.Painfully average.Grade: C.",6/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"I've seen this film twice and it still grips me.First off, Scott (Paul Rudd) has excellent chemistry with everyone. The way Hope shines alongside him as they fight together really shows how much a heroine she is, even though the original Wasp gets more fleshed-out here than she (which is fine, because it was Janet's turn for that). And in all his interaction with Cassie, the love feels real, the frustration feels real, and the camaraderie is 100% consistent with where her character was when she was young. I'm amazed at how much attention was paid to dramatic detail and character-arc continuity. (Some recent MCU releases have lacked in those areas.)Also, I genuinely appreciated that Scott didn't fully learn the lesson Cassie sought to instill in him (caring about the plight of strangers just as much as family members), so this leaves room for his character arc. I'm glad it wasn't instant-morality-learned-in-a-snap. And in subtle ways, she also saw that her naïveté lacked wisdom and planning. She had a lot of heart, but needed practicality. Again, room for character growth, and it was beautiful to see so much of that explored in an action film.And there were some other things left open, that I won't get into here, so I'll just say how much I appreciated that. Too many superhero movies wrap everything up in a nice little bow by the end.Finally, I loved how the movie didn't get bogged down in attempts at humor. To me it was just the right amount, and almost always felt natural. The acting chops of the cast certainly helped.Excited to see where the story goes next!",8/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania is pretty good with its scenes, action, the story. The story has to do with the family of Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), Hope (Evangeline Lilly), Cassie (Kathryn Newton), Janet (Michelle Pfeiffer), and Hank (Micheal Douglas) all being sent to the quantum realm and want to go back home safe and sound. Although, they meet obstacles along the way of the civilization of the Quantum Realm, M. O. D. O. K (Machine only designed only for Killing), and Kang the Conqueror in the way. Ant-Man must do what is best for his family and fight whatever is in his way to go back home. Overall, I thought it was a good MCU film because I liked the acting and story. Some stuff that I did not like is that that the film is mainly dialogue and setup for the next MCU films coming up. It was not the best MCU film out of all of them or great, but it is good for a single viewing in theaters in my opinion.",7/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"I've not liked much of the MCU in the last...2 years or so, I've had criticisms for it that some have thought aren't worthy criticisms and some have actually gotten upset at, but I've stuck true to my view that it's been a largely forgettable hodgepodge of mistakes and missed opportunities with a majority of writing very isolated and locked off with more focus on streaming Series than making a good plot for a movie.So that's not a good start going into this movie, the MCU had a large hill to climb to get back on track and I hate to say it but they failed again, but where to go from this as I'm not going to spoil things as I don't really want to talk about the plot as it's not that interesting, a villain is introduced that I'm not invested in as he's not been built up, but dropped in front of us and we're told to love this - again, without development of pace...again.I'm sort of ready to completely drop all Superhero movies from this point onwards as nothing is working, it's filled with irrelevance and can only get worse from here.Admittedly, everything LOOKS nice, but it's just superficial pretty colours on the screen to distract you from the very paper thin plot, weak characters and stilted and distracting acting, I keep mentioning it can't get worse with each new installment but I expect it will.",4/10

-Marvel really has a great budget to create worlds from our imagination and this installment continues to make it happen.-Lavish colors, odd beasts, a world that Strange World was trying to make but with more thought and layering.-Great cultures, a comic book sense of atmosphere, and a new world to which lots of foundations may just build from in the future.-Feels like a strong mash up of Star Wars, Marvel, and Battlestar with pinches of other movies to help spice up a few things with them as well. Nice references indeed.The Comedy At Times
-The comedy is awesome often thanks to writing and Paul Rudd making the lines come to life.-The snarky humor and sarcasm works very well, and I truly did laugh a bunch at how he just owns AntMan and makes it work on levels to be fun.-There are plenty of aggressive lines that will be there for people to enjoy, several filled with cursing so caution, but it works when in balance and timed just right.-And some running gags add a little spice to the mix as well, and that was awesome to say the least.-Overall, the comedy works for me, but there are limitations to be mentioned at a later section.The Action At Times
-The action does have these moments that show Marvel can still make a good fight.-Choreography has some flavor, the powers are fun, and the use of that awesome design comes out pretty well.-Several moments have some impressive strategy behind it, and again surprises me with how some of these stunt people can move.-And there is musical and visual support to help make everything come to life and have that movie magic that we love in these films.-Throw in some emotional moments that work to add that bite and edge, and several comedic moments, and AntMan 3 really helps add a little more sauce to the factor that many come to these movies for.The Character Development At Times
-Kang is the lead for me on this film, in just how much they took the one moment we had with him before and amplifies it so well. He gets a lot of time to flourish and I totally agree that he is worth it.-As for Scott, again he and Janet get some surprising levels that I love and these moments really help amplify those who seem somewhat forgettable, a joke of the movie, and really bring them to the forefront to be the heroes we want.The Acting
-Marvel is not often loaded with duds, so I can't say that I was surprised to see a strong hand played for this film.-I'd say just about everyone hits their mark, but I have limited room, so I'll stick to the three top listed and go from there.-Rudd is hilarious, hands down a solid balance of comedy, emotion, and bravado that establishes the themes of this movie and often does not stray into overacting. So natural in his delivery he keeps entertainment and drama in check.-Lilly was fine in her time on the screen, but I can't say that Hope had the same punches or influence on me as the past. She seemed a little laid back, lackluster, and then finally picks it up but not to the degree I've seen her in other films.-Majors though, wow, Majors kills this role. The man knows how to articulate movements, add elements to his speech and craft this role so well. Kang is such a layered villain and Majors destroys it with the way he incorporates so much into one man. What a fantastic ability to do so much.DISLIKES:The Pace Is A Fast
-Normally this is a good thing, and by the end you'll see why it might be a bit bad.-Quantumania really has a lot of things launching from it, and not everything was fleshed out, thought through, or detailed as Phase 1 and 2 were able to do for the most part.-It was great to see so much, and yet, it moved a tad too fast for me to really get everything down and have that commitment.-Perhaps they tried to launch too much and had they toned back, several parts of this could have had a consistently strong bite that these climactic moments had.-Though my bladder was happy, I think this one needed to slow down a bit in my opinion.The Character Development Is Bland At Times
-With that pace, some development felt a bit simplified and lacking.-Hope gets little for me in terms of truly worthwhile investment, and Hank is more comedic than truly amazing, lost to a secondary character status.-Several other new members are there to have an inconsistent bite, and though there are shining moments, there are sadly not the same speed that I like in my character stories.-Thus, these blander moments aren't the worst, but given the magic of Avengers and Civil War, I guess I expected more in this tale.Many Elements Feel Simplified:
-Again, there is a lot of potential in this movie, and yet... did it fully achieve it?-Some levels, yes, there are these champion aspects I wish I got more time with and had smoother transitions.-And yet other things just felt so watered down. Several cultural tribes and relationships. New characters who had abilities to dig out things, but were comedic only, and even several elements of exploration were lost.-All this build up at times sometimes just flops out and again, we are left with a bare bone, C-grade means to tell the tale.The Comedy Forced Sometimes
-There is plenty of good laughs to be had and I admit again I chuckled a bunch, especially some of the adult jokes.-But... again we have been robbed of balance and sometimes the comedy tried too hard to be funny for me and tripped up the momentum to be had.-A running gag about how to punch sometimes flopped for me, other times it was just stopping to joke during an action scene, and other times was just a joke going too far for me that it lost its edge for me.-I'm not saying it reached levels of Thor, but... I can also say sometimes the edge needed to win and stay while the jokes were left behind.The Action Could Have Been More
-Again, there are moments where the action is on fire and some of the best I've seen in a while.-But that doesn't mean it approaches the level that other films have done and given the buildup, I guess I feel more of it than other films.-Many action sequences last less than 5 minutes, with a tad simplification and a minimization to the chaos they could have had.-A few bad guys to beat down or at least scare off? Maybe a run in with Kang earlier and fleeing from him to an extent far less trivial.-And they still have not gotten big battles with lots of pieces the due time and natural development I know they can do.-Thus, the action could have been more in my opinion.The VERDICT
The opening hand for Phase 5 is heavy and truly a visionary wonder to behold. AntMan's third trip to the screens is loaded with a bunch of things you might like in regards to your movie with action, comedy, edge, emotion, and stakes that have been absent in a lot of Marvel's productions. It really has a lot of good in my opinion and has done the job of set up and entertainment to the point that there is a lot to uncover. Some good character use, a dab of emotion, and some focus on evolving characters is a nice foundation, and the comedic antics with the comic capers of fighting further help add the spice to things that I like in a movie. Not to mention, Majors really is a welcome addition for me and what he has done with a villain in terms of exciting layers. And yet, the movie still has balance issues, primarily in the form of doing a consistent job of handling everything and not doing too much. I think there was a lot they try to accomplish, which they kind of did, but I just think more time or less content would have helped with character usage, action, and that full effect I like to see in other movies. Still, I don't think this is horrible, nor do I think it is perfect, but the opening gamble was enjoyable for me. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Comedy: 8.0
Movie Overall: 7.0.",8/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"Doesnt deserve the 50-55 percent its getting by critics. Its a fun movie to see in theatres. I loved seeing the Pym family on the big screen together. Hank Pym, Kang, and Scott Lang were all fun characters. The plot wasnt a masterpiece but ive seen much worse big tentpole blockbusters like Transformers that i felt empty after watching. This movie is solid entertainment with a somewhat meddling middle act but a very fun final act. Picture Tron: Legacy and thats this movie. Its a single story part of a bigger continuing universe. See this because its a solid scfi somewhat family mcu movie. Thor Love and Thunder had a bad final act but I really enjoyed the final act in this one.",7/10
Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania (2023),"We're all sucked into a world of microcosm, it's quite familiar, but it's also quite an odd'n, a galaxy of failed auditions, inept, forgetful compositions, it's recycled, reinvented, repetition. It's fair to say, the dialogue's a chore, excessive CGI that soon becomes a bore, there is very little spark, to a disengaging arc, at least the runtime's not excessive (although still too long for what it delivers), you don't want more - which is a shame, because Jonathan Majors is a seriously talented chap, but as Kang The Conqueror, he deserves no big backslap, while Bill Murray plays Bill Murray, though neither humorous or funny, and the also rans are outplayed by the ants - while the rest of the cast take their green screen cash and disappear into a multiverse of madness.",4/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"Ummmmm, where do I begin. I didn't watch any trailers or read any reviews. I saw the poster and title and thought, ""I'm definitely watching that."" After seeing it, I can say with confidence that it's exactly what a movie named Cocaine Bear should be.Aside from being an extremely fun and outrageous thriller, this movie is hysterical. I was full-volume laughing frequently. So many parts are the perfect combination of memorable and hilarious. It knows exactly what it's doing.The other thing that made me happy is seeing a studio have the courage to allow the filmmakers to go all out. I compare it to M3gan which was going for a similar tone. But M3gan was toned down to PG-13 so teens could watch. Cocaine Bear is rated R as it absolutely should be. It's not gratuitous but it never feels like it's holding back.I had a blast with this movie. If the title or premise intrigue you, you will most likely be pleased. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 2/23/2023)",8/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"I first groaned and rolled my eyes when I heard they made a film about a bear on cocaine, named Cocaine Bear. I Googled the name to look for the trailer, and stumbled on the Wikipedia page where I learned this movie is loosely based on actual events, and that's what sold me to give it a watch. If the fact a bear actually found and did cocaine for months isn't funny enough alone to give this film a watch, I don't know what is.I'm just glad the filmmakers and producers took the already hilarious true concept, and made a film just as ridiculously funny. It's been a while I've heard an entire theatre burst out in laughter so many times. The entire film was simply put, comedy gold. The story could've been a little tighter in a few of the subplots, but the casting of the various colorful characters and all their performances made up for any of the writing issues.The 95 min runtime was just right, as was the pacing, and the soundtrack was awesome and spot-on for that era. This truly is one of those rare ridiculous films that actually worked. It's a fun ride start to finish. Final fun fact; the actual taxidermied bear can be found at the Kentucky Fun Mall in Kentucky USA.",8/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"This film is exactly what you think it is. It's a bear on cocaine going crazy in the woods. That doesn't mean it's not good. It's actually surprisingly good.It's such a good thriller. You're on the edge of your seat for most of it and when you're not on the edge of your seat, you're laughing your ass off.The cast is actually very unrelated. Keri Russell is phenomenal. Alden Ehrenreich And O'Shea Jackson Jr (Ice Cube's son) are great together and have great chemistry.The production value is so so it is definitely not a super high budget film. But it doesn't look bad. The editing as well done especially during the action scenes and the CGI is actually pretty good.",8/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"What a wild ride! The ""ambulance scene"" alone makes this movie worth a watch. Totally insane, scary, funny and gory. The bear is really well made and most of the scenes with it are bananas. A lot of different characters throughout the movie. They all have their own sub plot but they blend pretty well. When it tends to drag a little bit the bear always pops out for more fun and kills so it's always entertaining and goofy. Great directing, special effects and acting. Most of the easy jokes landed, the whole theatre was laughing out loud the entire movie. A good comedy horror entry. Nothing revolutionary but ultimately a really fun popcorn movie.",8/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"Cocaine Bear offers little beyond the trailers in terms of originality, flashiness, or cleverness, but it does offer more of the same...and a lot of it. Chances are, however you interpret the trailers and however you feel about them will determine how you enjoy this movie. If you're ready for a leave-your-brain-at-home 80's adventure of slasher gore (sans human antagonist) and some corny punchlines, then this is your ticket. I would be lying if I said I did not have the occasional chuckle, and truth be told, some of SFX company Weta's bear animations were uncomfortably realistic at times. Ultimately though, I found myself several times throughout the brisk 95 minute runtime wishing the film would tingle my brain with abstractions that never came.My advice? If you like the trailer, see it in theaters. If you were indifferent about the trailer, wait until it hits streaming.",6/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"If you hear that the actress who played Effie in the Hunger Games movies has directed a flick in which a forest animal goes on a coked-up rampage, you'll probably think that there's some sort of joke going around. Well fear not. Elizabeth Banks's ""Cocaine Bear"" knows exactly what kind of movie it is and then some. In addition to the plot - loosely based on a real incident - we get some references to '80s pop culture (as well as the era's drug scare).And of course there's the cast. In addition to the CGI ursine star, we have Keri Russell, Brooklynn Prince (of ""The Florida Project""), Margo Martindale, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, O'Shea Jackson Jr (Ice Cube's son), and Ray Liotta in his final role. Basically, this is one movie that you're bound to enjoy. This plus the miniseries ""Black Bird"" jointly constituted an outstanding end to Ray Liotta's career.In conclusion, the odds were definitely in Elizabeth Banks's favor!",9/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"Give Elizabeth Banks an award for bringing funny back to the movies. If Tom Cruise & Top Gun saved the movies last year, Elizabeth saved comedies this year. Don't go in looking for a drama. Go in and leave your brains at the door.It takes a lot for me to laugh with tears, but I did with this movie. It was stupid, silly, fun, unbelievable and just plain laugh-out loud funny.Now I don't know if cocaine can have that effect on a bear. But I really don't care. The funniest scene was when the bear fell on the guy and the ""he"" we thought the bear was, turned out to be a ""she."" And how did he know? Because the VayVay was sitting on his head. Whoever wrote that scene needs a writers award.",8/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"'Cocaine Bear' does exactly what it says on the box - it's a film about a black bear in Georgia, USA, that gets high from some cocaine dumped in the forest and goes on a rampage. Very loosely based on a true story, where illegal drugs actually were thrown out of a plane and killed a bear. Needless to say, the bear is CGI. The cast is surprisingly strong, with the main cast of 'The Americans' present - Russell, Rhys & Martindale - along with Ehrenreich (from 'Solo'), Jackson Jr (from 'Obi-Wan Kenobi'), Whitlock Jr (from heaps of stuff) & Ray Liotta's final ever role.Even though it has funny parts, there's probably not enough consistently funny jokes or moments to be a true comedy. Likewise with the horror/thriller aspect - there's some scary moments, but nothing sustained or truly horrific. A bit of gore and I think the death tally reached 9 in the end, but probably needed to be a few more to reach actual horror territory.It's basically a creature feature, and I'd put it alongside 'The Meg' and 'Piranha 3D', rather than 'Jaws' or 'King Kong'. The cast are all likeable, but their skills are severely underutilised. The score is good and some of the shots of the Chattahoochee forest are nice. The ending is a bit underwhelming with too much family drama.",5/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"I just got out of Cocaine Bear.This movie was awful. I was hoping for a 'so bad it's good' type of movie, where I laugh at the absurdity of it all, as giant bear that has done cocaine rips everybody apart!! You know a nice bit of gore/comedy. It even failed on that level. I didn't laugh once, it's just plain bad. I had more fun with the three Sharknado movies, let that sink in!!It's not funny, it's not intense and it's not scary. I spent most of my time trying to figure out where I knew the mother from (It's the Bon Jovi music video for Always) likewise her daughter (She was the young girl in The Turning)At one point I checked my watch to see how long was left, as nothing seemed to be happening, and it was only half an hour in. I thought it was at least double that.We spend time with a bunch of human characters, that I just didn't care about, so there was no stakes at all. Ray Liotta is there The guy who played Han Solo in Solo has a bigger role as his son. Jesse Tyler Fergurson (from Modern Family) has a small role, but the standout for me was Margo Metindale as the ranger. But it is a low bar, as the acting is not great.There was one Sly Stallone related thing, that I waited to see if there was a pay off to, but there wasn't!! I was more bothered about that, than any of the human characters.It's dialogue is cringe, the violence is tame and nothing to wrote home about, at all and it's not funny. The trailer suggested a dark horror comedy. This movie did not live up to the trailer .As for Elizabeth Banks.... I preferred Charlies AngelsAn unfunny (I'm not sure of it was trying to be, but the actors seemed to think they were in a comedy, based on the performances) badly edited, dull, waste of talent and time. This goes on my worst of the year list.",4/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"...And it's very good at being just that.Granted, I really didn't expect a lot from a film called Cocaine Bear. What I did expect was some satisfying creature violence and some darkly humorous comedy to pad the time between the carnage. And the film 100% delivered on these fronts.I truly appreciated that the script wasted no time. We get to see our titular monster bear in action from the opening scene, then we get the bear minimum (pun intended) of character exposition for all the people who may or may not get mauled, and we're off to the races for more bloody fun.And oh, it's pretty fun. The CGI for the bear is shockingly good at times, and the gore is always impressive. It's not shown all the time, which was smart of them. It's only really shown at brief moments for maximum shock. Elizabeth Banks actually does have a knack for this, as it turns out. Color me pleasantly surprised.Of course, not all the characters get to shine. Would you expect them to? Most of them are pretty disposable. But even the inconsequential ones get fun personalities and all the actors give it their all and are clearly having fun, no matter how small their roles.What did surprise me most was that the film actually does give the true lead characters some heartfelt beats and emotional lessons that they take away from their horrific day in the woods.One man learns to appreciate his friends amidst his grief, another learns to stand up for what's right, a mother and daughter learn to prioritise each other, etc. It's nothing groundbreaking or powerful by any means, but it did make me feel something.And I truly did not expect a movie called Cocaine Bear to make me feel anything. The film won't be a timeless classic, but it's a really good time at the movies.And Y'know what? If it's not trying to be anything other than that, I'm perfectly happy with it.",8/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),The story is very simple; a cocaine shipment falls in the wrong place (a National Park) and a bear eat it and become very very excited and violent. Obviously the drug dealers are looking for it; but there a couple of kids lost and their mother trying to find them.To my surprise; originally looked like a campy B horror movie; it was a really a very well acted comedy (well a black one) with some very violent scenes and impressive (and very gory) special effects.Based on real events; the movie (obviously many things are imagined) the movie tris to avoid the DUMB POEPLE humor but using not good but not really that bad characters.O'Shea Jackson Jr. Is incredible funny as drug dealer that try to look more bad that really is. Alden Ehrenreich is also good as a gay man sweeping because of his lost lover. Ray Liotta in his last performance is the more serious but still very good.But there also a lot secondary characters that make the movie even funnier. The ambulance chase scene is outstanding but there several others almost as good.In brief: there is some gore but the is really really fun to watch and never boriing.,10/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"You don't need a lengthy analysis or someone to recap the film here...you already know this is ""Cocaine Bear!"" Anything else can spoil the movie experience. I am certain this will be a HUGE hit. They may already be working on sequels. Allow me to suggest:Cocaine Bear 2: Mushroom Bear (Trippin' on psilocybin)Cocaine Bear 3: Molly Bear (Luvs everybody)Cocaine Bear 4: Cannabis Bear (Uncontrollable munchies)Cocaine Bear 5: Viagra Bear (self-explanatory)The title pretty much tells you what kind of movie to expect and delivers as promised. If you expect too much ...then you may be disappointed, but I don't think anyone who is going to see this film is expecting an Oscar-worthy meaningful masterpiece. Yeah, I guess the movie could have been better (definitely not a 10-star film), but compared to other things in this category; I think it's above average and effort was made to produce something entertaining.I predict the ""Cocaine Bear"" films will become quite a successful franchise. I'm actually kicking myself right now and thinking: ""Why didn't I come up with this first?!""",7/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"Cocaine Bear unfortunately doesn't completely live up to its terrific premise, taking way too long to actually get going with too many characters. Thankfully it's still good enough with just enough moments that get it right combined with its ability to get you to actually care about its characters.The cast are all fine, able to do their parts well but it's O'Shea Jackson Jr. And Alden Ehrenreich who are by far the best characters and the most fun to spend time with thanks to their consistently enjoyable back and forth and surprisingly emotional journey.Elizabeth Banks' direction is good overall, it's competently shot and there's enough moments that are cleverly self aware enough to cancel out the lack of tension and missed opportunities. The CG isn't amazing but the bear looks convincing enough.",6/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"This movie was bonkers of fun I saw a little after 5pm Thursday and was wildly entertained! Plenty of shock value, hilarious behavior, brutal, solid dialogue, the bear madness was insane and the cinematography was incredibly done. A bold fun movie by Elizabeth Banks that should be considered a hit! An interesting final role for Ray Liotta being a villain and looked rough I'm sure the entire crew was happy to work with him regardless. I absolutely loved Cocaine Bear I'll want to own it when available. O' Shea Jackson, Isaiah Whitlock JR, Keri Russel, Aldren Ehrenreich and The Bear were all fantastic!Come on my review isn't that bad and the movie is great fun. I have autism and I tend to enjoy more cinema than most besides I was anticipating Cocaine Bear for at least a year I wasn't disappointed at all.",10/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"From the film's title, you can probably guess that this is a one-joke movie, a premise borne out in the trailer and in the picture itself. But, frankly, who cares? This delightfully campy dark comedy arguably has a few pacing and editing issues, as well as some bits that fall a little flat, but it's generally a filling smorgasbord of over-the-top, goofy, gory fun. Director Elizabeth Banks's third feature outing definitely won't appeal to everyone because of its rampant silliness and its gratuitous shock value that's more than a fitting homage to the cheesy, tacky 1980s slasher movies reminiscent of the time frame in which this fact-based true story is based. In essence, the premise is a simple one: a plane carrying an enormous stash of the powdery white substance crashes in the Chattahoochee National Forest, depositing its cargo within reach of a CGI-generated black bear who immediately becomes hooked on this find and embarks on an out-of-control murderous rampage, taking down an array of characters who have varying connections to the locale, the payload or other related considerations. And, yes, for what it's worth, this soon becomes a one-note narrative, but the note is played differently every time it's struck, with funny little twists and ever-more grisly (but creatively hilarious) imagery thrown in for good measure, the kind of laughs typical of cult classics and the fare of midnight shows. This offering also features fine performances by the likes of Margot Martindale, Christian Convery and the late Ray Liotta in his final screen portrayal, all of whom were good sports in recognizing the high-camp factor of this material. Look, let's face it, drugs are often an inherently funny source of gut-busting humor (more so here literally than in many other cinematic vehicles), so just go with it on that level rather than trying to assess it otherwise - and running the risk of succumbing to the logic contained in the screeds of tiresome, droll, stick-in-the-mud naysayers (as many allegedly esteemed critics have already written about in their dour, dull, joyless, overly somber evaluations). Enjoy this one in the kitschy spirit in which it was intended - and ignore anyone who screams ""just say no.""",7/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"This was a fun ride for the first little while, but they shouldn't have shoehorned in a villain-arc in the later half. It was too much story for the ludicrous premise to support.We also really needed to see more of the kids being outrageous, and we DEFINITELY needed more of Margo Martindale's park ranger! What a waste of an incredible talent!The film would have been a lot better if it focused on her and the kids instead of following Keri Russell's blandly forgettable nurse around, not to mention the crooks whose entire story-arc felt wholly unnecessary.5/10 Stars. I enjoyed the opening and most of the first half, but was bored to tears by the end.",5/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"Inspired by the 1985 true story of a drug runner's plane crash, missing cocaine, and the black bear that ate it, this wild dark comedy finds an oddball group of cops, criminals, tourists and teens converging in a Georgia forest where a 500- pound apex predator has ingested a staggering amount of cocaine and gone on a coke-fueled rampage for more blow... and blood.Starring Keri Russell, O'Shea Jackson Jr., Alden Ehrenreich, and Ray Liotta in one of his final roles, Cocaine Bear manages to do a disservice to every single one of them. Russell, known for her talents on television in The Americans, a gripping thriller that displays the actress' immense talents, manages to convey little of that skill or charm here. While not fully her fault (she's served with a script that's dead on arrival), this movie may prove to be one of her worst performances to date. Playing Sari (there isn't a character in this film that has a full first and last name), the mother of a child who's gone missing in the same woods the eponymous coked out bear is rampaging in, Russell has little to do other than fret and cast about the forest in search of her daughter.Likewise with O'Shea Jackson Jr. As Daveed, a member of the local drug ring tasked with retrieving the lost product. Jackson's rapport with Alden Ehrenreich may be the best thing about the movie; the two have decent chemistry together, and in a world where the actors were given substantial roles and parts with actual depth, some magic could've been made. The real shame comes with this being one of the final on screen performances of Ray Liotta. Known best for his work on Scorsese's Goodfellas, Liotta's career was always one of hits and misses, but the movie makes for a sad note to begin a career ending run on.Directed by Elizabeth Banks, Cocaine Bear makes for her third directorial feature. There's signs of promise with Banks, but sadly due to being restricted with such lackluster material it doesn't provide her with the ability to fully spread her wings. Still, the film's pacing keeps things moving at a quick clip, throwing the audience right into the thick of it early and doing what it can to keep the energy up. The script, written by Jimmy Warden, is far and away the weakest point of the entire production. Paper-thin characters, undercooked plot lines, and terrible dialogue make this movie borderline unbearable.Overall, Cocaine Bear, while fun in concept, is an unsalvageable film. From subpar acting to lackluster directing, the end result is a funny short story stretched out over 95 agonizing minutes. Neither plot line has enough meat to last the entire film and somehow both combined still can't stretch to create a compelling enough narrative when the bear is off screen. While the bear itself warrants laughs during its blow-fueled quest for more cocaine, the human element is what holds the story back from being anything worthwhile. At best, this is a Friday night movie with friends after multiple drinks.",4/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"I love cheesy low budget movies. The low budget usually means the film makers need to get creative with what they do have and that can lead to some wild ,fun movies. Unfortunately, if they don't get creative, then you're stuck with a movie that is hard to watch.Cocaine Bear has it's bright spots. It's a great premise for a movie. There are a few good scenes that grab your attention or make you laugh. But there's too much dead space. It feels like they had a few good key scenes in mind, like the ambulance scene, and then just wrote the rest of the movie around them. So you have a few cool scenes and the rest is just filler.That's really sad because making a movie called Cocaine Bear a fun entertaining movie should have been a slam dunk. Hollywood had made cheesy, low budget Nature Goes Haywire type movies for decades. Some of them are drek. But some are entertaining. The creators had plenty of moves to choose from to give them an idea of how this type of film works.I do want to give a shout out to Jesse Tyler Ferguson He got into the spirit of the thing and his character was fun. But overall there were just too many gaps between anything fun or interesting. Cocaine Bear just didn't get me high enough.",5/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"I understand that when you make a movie like 'Cocaine Bear' you can't take yourself too seriously or else it will be a death sentence for your movie. There is a way to make a film silly fun without making it completely unbearable (I'm sorry) for anyone above 11 years old to enjoy, however. And this film did not do that.I love comedy-horror when it's done right. I've found the key to getting these films right though is the humour. The horror elements will always be hit and miss, but if the audience is laughing along the way then they will forgive the imperfections in the horror. I didn't laugh once during 'Cocaine Bear'. The editing was very strange. It kept stepping on all the jokes. Every time a line that could've potentially been funny came up it would quickly cut to the next scene before it had time to breathe, almost as if the film was embarrassed by the standard of the joke.So when its not funny you only really have the bear scenes to look forward to. There are some decent kills I will give the movie credit for that. It wasn't afraid to be quite brutal at times. But the CGI of the bear looked awful and really took me out of a lot of scenes.I didn't go into 'Cocaine Bear' expecting a masterpiece, but I also didn't go in expecting to be checking my watch multiple times during a 95 minute film. This was a disappointing effort. 4/10.",4/10

Cocaine Bear (2023),"Director Elizabeth Banks undoubtedly thought the premise of the movie then, perhaps, laughed and most likely told her cast to just remember that they are making a bear on cocaine flick and have fun. But what did it have to be so...bland.The story is of a real life drug smuggling incident where a ton of cocaine was dropped from the sky and then a bear ingests the bulk of it only to die within minute. This is the germination of the story of weirdos attempting to recover it. Though it takes place in the mid-1980s, the way this is shot and constructed is too modern for the tone it was attempting to set. It buries the flick in a lot of needle drop familiar tunes, which should placate a lot of Gen Xers. But it does so more as a distraction that the idea became anemic somewhere in the middle. It becomes a drawn out skit that is painfully uneven. I found myself sighing how wonderfully funny this could've been. Wasted are the chops of Margo Matindale, Ehren Ehrenreich and O'Shea Jackson Jr. Who seem to have lines spoonfed to them in an awkward attempt to make them more human. People don't act this way. And if they do in this universe, perhaps have it boil down to one adventure and not four. You have -- Father/Son/Friend drug dealers, Woman Looking for her kid in the woods, Punks harassing campers as Park Ranger thwarts them, Local cop leaving to investigate where the cocaine disappeared. There is just too much movie here. And EVERYONE cracks wise.All to the truly wasted talent of Keri Russell. She plays a mother who is desperate to find her daughter in this madcapped mess.I'm not sure what Banks's motivation was to make this. Perhaps it was just to make something dumb and fun. It is neither of those. It seems, midway through, to truly take itself too seriously. The cocaine jokes are tiring. We get it, people on cocaine are funny (I guess). That trope is so drained of nuance it was ballsy to attempt to resuscitate it. Instead, this is a bland comedy. Worst that we feel nothing when these despicable people do dumb things and are done away with by the bear.Though only under 100 minutes this felt VERY long. Prologuing it with a joke about Europeans first encountering the bear. Ugh.Make it stop.",4/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"I saw this at a pre screening event and man am I happy I did!""Cocaine Bear"" delivers everything that you wanted it to be: a ridiculous plot, over-the-top violence and just a fun time at the movies without being slapped around with political and social agendas.Elizabeth Banks learned her lesson from a few years ago when she did ""Charlie's Angels"", and went down a path of pure fun.""Bear"" starts out in the mid-1980s, with a character throwing bags of cocaine over the mountains in Georgia, and Tennessee. While jumping out of the plane, he smacks his head and immediately crash lands into somebody's driveway. What happened to all the bags of cocaine? Well, a bear got them.And this is where the fun starts.The ultra violent and hilarious look at what could have happen (we know that the bear in real life died in a few hours, and likely didn't kill anyone), makes this movie a great date night, or if you just want to get away from life for a few hours.The jokes are all deadpan, very reminiscent of the ""Knocked Up"" and ""Superbad"" era from the mid 2000's, and they work oh so well.Do yourself a favor and watch this movie with a crowded theater, or, with your friends. You're definitely gonna wanna watch this with a group of people!",8/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"I had such a fun experience with this movie! Please go see it with all your friends, and it'll make the experience that much better, or at least see it with a large crowd. The movie kinda starts a little slow because we're getting to meet and know all the characters, but the movie kicks in to high gear soon as the bear gets her cocaine fix.You'll meet Sari, a mom who's trying to do right by her daughter, Dee Dee. Dee Dee and her friend, Henry decide to skip school and go explore the woods. Tracking down the cocaine are Daveed and Eddie. Eddie is the son of a major drug dealer named Syd (Played by the late Ray Liotta. Hot on their trail is an aged cop named Bob. Sari meets up with Rangers Liz and Peter in hopes of finding her daughter and friend. Got all that?Now is where the fun begins! The bear finds bags of cocaine that was dropped from a plane and starts eating it and begins going crazy and has a rampage all over town. The ambulance scene was one of the best parts of the film. The film is gory, cheesy, campy, and fun; everything it sets out to do. So far, this has been of the better movies of 2023 and destined to become a cult classic. I would highly recommend COCAINE BEAR!!!",10/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"December 1985. A drug smuggler, who also happens to be a former narcotics officer, is piloting a plane when he realises his cargo is far too heavy. In an attempt to lighten his load, he drops multiple duffel bags full of cocaine out of the plane. The pilot, Andrew C. Thornton II, then decides to chase after his fallen goods but fails and plummets to his death below. The duffel bags of cocaine, worth almost fifteen million US dollars, falls into the hands of a 175-pound American black bear who decides to consume it. The bear who, under this incredible influence, goes on a drug-fueled killing spree......I don't know wether my expectations were too high, or I wasn't in the mood, but Cocaine Bear just didn't resonate with me. I was sold on the title alone, and I wanted it to be a slice of exploitative B-movie mayhem. And while it does deliver that in very minute doses. It's a case of not delivering enough of the titular character. Call me spoilt, but I wanted more bear and less exposition.So we spend the majority of the film with two separate story arcs, in search of something or someone, and you can feel every lethargic step the groups are taking.When the Bear is on screen, it's fun, and the ambulance scene is a really good set piece, but one set piece does not make a good movie.The cast are fine, but they spend the majority of the film doing the last thing you want to do when there is a crazed, drug fuelled Bear lurking in the woods, shouting, and walking aimlessly about looking for the same thing the bear is.For a film with a title that sells you the instant you read it, it's a cracking bear, sorry bore and the ninety plus minutes it's on feels almost double that. It's major disappointment, because in the right hands, such as Neveldine and Taylor, is could have been something special.But it's from Elizabeth Banks, and she directed that abhorrent reboot of Charlie's Angels back in 2019, and that about says it all.Liotta, God rest his soul is fine, but he could have done this role in his sleep, and he looks bored.So all in all, it's not terrible, it does have its moments, but at times it can be close to un-Bear-able.",5/10
Cocaine Bear (2023),"I gave it a full 30 minutes. It was awful from the start, but you have to give any film a chance. It's not exactly a comedy, nor a horror, nor a crime, nor really anything. Well, that's not an immediate killer. But it also didn't have as single bit on good acting despite some very credible actors. It failed to take advantage of what might have been great scenery. The bits with the bear are mostly a fake bear's arm that shows up from time to time. Occasionally you see a real bear, but it's never doing anything remarkable.Most of the actors are in two shots and they probably never got to see what a mess this film is. The idea is wonderful. That's what got me there to waste a half hour4 of my life.Avoid this like the plague it is. It isn't the worst film ever made, but it is the worst film I've seen in years.",2/10
The Whale (2022),"I think there are some good reasons to criticize this film. It's a fairly stage bound adaptation of a play. That's not always a bad thing. In many cases, staging a film very similarly to the way the play was staged accentuates what works about the play. I don't think it really does here, and the film's repetitive structures leads to some dead patches. There's also a powerfully melodramatic tone to this film that I'm frankly just a bit unsure of.I also think there are extremely bad reasons to criticize the film, and these reasons are starting to emerge as the consensus among critics in the mainstream media. This isn't a film about a very fat man. It's a film about someone with an extremely destructive eating addiction caused by grief and regret and the complete lack of self-worth that accompanies those feelings sometimes. There have been films that deal with drugs, alcohol, gambling and sex, but apparently when it comes to food, the only thing that this film can be doing is inviting you to gawk at the big fat guy. It's a very strange conclusion to reach that I speculate is generated by coming into the film dead set on the idea that this is all it can be doing.I did not come away from this film with any notion that I was supposed to see Frasier as anything less than a human being deserving of our deepest empathy. The film parades in some shocking imagery, especially up front, but I found that once I confronted it, my initial reaction subsided and I was seeing Frasier for who he was. I think it's an extraordinary double-standard that people can watch Nicolas Cage indulge in ridiculous and cartoonish bouts of binge drinking in ""Leaving Las Vegas"" and declare brilliance, but balk at Frasier's fits of VERY CLEARLY self-annihilating eating in this film and think we are only supposed to be processing it as some kind of freak show.I don't think this is an incredible film, and I wouldn't place it among Aronofsky's best. I do think Frasier's performance is brilliant, and the film is a flawed, but often marvelous character piece about a kind of addiction we seldom confront.",8/10
The Whale (2022),Let me start by saying I've been a fan of Fraser since seeing Encino Man as a kid and this guy will always be one of my favorites. To see him somehow thrown out of Hollywood/not casted for the most part for the past decade was very frustrating for me. It was about time someone gave him another chance which Aronofsky and A24 did and it proved successful mainly because of Brendan's dedicated and emotional performance.The film itself is quite less pretentious and more honest than most of A24 films to date . It also has more of a down to earth straight forward delivery than most of Aronofsky's perplexing work. Honestly with the subject matter it needed to be and relies mostly on pure emotion and struggle which is shown masterfully by Fraser.There have been a lot of preconceived outraged overreactions and ridiculous assumptions based on the fact that Fraser is wearing a fat suit/getting prosthetics to appear as a morbidly obese person. I don't see why this is a problem mainly due to the fact this is a film made to entertain and to do so sometimes you wear things or makeup to alter looks. It would be difficult to cast a real life person off the street and have them pour their real emotions out on screen. I don't see that being easy.Also this is so much deeper than the looks of Fraser in the film and that's the true intention and power of this piece. People must see this raw and moving performance from Brendan and it's sure to cause a stir. This is the due Renaissance and comeback for Mr. Fraser. Oscar should be coming his way.,8/10
The Whale (2022),"Darren Aronofsky's ""The Whale"" is a deeply moving story about redemption, loss, and trauma. It revolves around a morbidly obese middle-aged man named Charlie who after losing his boyfriend goes into complete shock and denial and starts to gain weight uncontrollably. After his boyfriend tragically passed away, Charlie gives up hope and becomes a nihilist and rather pessimistic, as opposed to an eternal optimist in which he is remembered as. He uses food as a coping mechanism to suppress his deep-rooted feelings. This insatiable hunger lasts for eight years, until his rebellious daughter Ellie shows up. Charlie wants to reconnect with his estranged daughter, whereas his daughter feels differently. The title refers to Herman Melville's seminal novel ""Moby Dick"", which plays an important part in the narrative of the movie. In fact, it foreshadows the eventual climax of the film, which will tear audiences apart. The final minutes of the film completely wrecked me, thanks to Brendan Fraser's incredible performance and his instant chemistry with Sadie Sink. I wouldn't be surprised if the film garners Oscar nominations in the best actor and best supporting actress categories for Brendan Fraser and Sadie Sink respectively. Hong Chau is a knockout, as well.Final verdict: 8.5/10.",8/10
The Whale (2022),"Greetings again from the darkness. Brendan Fraser deserves an Oscar nomination. There's a sentence I never even imagined writing. If you recall (and you are excused if you don't), Mr. Fraser's early acting career is noted for such 'prestige' films as ENCINO MAN (1992), GEORGE OF THE JUNGLE (1997), DUDLEY DO-RIGHT (1999), and BEDAZZLED (2000). And yes, I'm being a bit unfair in the films I chose to name, as he has also had some solid performances along the way. However, nothing on his resume could have prepared us for what he delivers on screen in this latest from director Darren Aronofsky (BLACK SWAN, 2010).Award-winning playwright Samuel D Hunter adapted his own play for the big screen, and it's one that will surely drag you down and pound your emotions, even as it mesmerizes you. We first hear Charlie's (Fraser) soothing voice as he addresses the online college writing class he teaches. We see the students' faces on his laptop, but Charlie's square is blacked out. He explains the camera on his laptop is still ""broken"". Class ends and Charlie's friend Liz (a terrific Hong Chau, ""Watchmen"") shows up to read his blood pressure at 238/134. Charlie is a massive human being, barely mobile, and nearing death.Liz is also a nurse and tends to Charlie in a sense of loyalty and caring through their friendship ... the origin of which we learn later in the story. Thomas (Ty Simpkins, JURASSIC WORLD, 2015), who says he's a missionary from New Life Ministries, knocks on the door as Charlie is in medical distress. Liz treats Thomas as an intruder and demands he leave, while Charlie remains civil to him. Given his ticking clock, Charlie reaches out to his teenage daughter Ellie (Sadie Sink, ""Stranger Things""). The two haven't seen each other in the years since Charlie left for a new lover. To say that Ellie has pent-up rage and anger directed at her long-lost dad would be understating the situation. She blows into his apartment like a tornado, spewing venom towards Charlie. They do come to an arrangement that entices her to return to visit while he agrees to assist with her delinquent school assignments.Almost the entirety of the story takes place in about 300 square feet of the upstairs apartment Charlie is confined to. The tight space adds tension to every interaction between the four characters, including Charlie's ex-wife Mary (Samantha Morton, IN AMERICA, one of my favorite forgotten gems from 20 years ago). Brendan Fraser uses his eyes to convey so many thoughts, even as we turn in disgust at his eating habits. An excellent score from Rob Simonsen and expert camera work from cinematographer Matthew Libatique complement the stunning performance from Fraser, and the numerous moments of intense tension and emotional turmoil. There are only a few times throughout where the live stage source material sticks out, and the ending is handled beautifully, allowing us a respite from the emotional rollercoaster of the past two hours.Now showing in theaters.",8/10
The Whale (2022),"There's a part of this movie that even before going in I was apprehensive about. Is it exploitative? More than probably, yes. Is it phobic in a certain way? It isn't impossible to think that. But being far removed from certain aspects of what the movie shows and yet being so close and feeling related to a lot of other things the movie portrays, I can only speak from what I got and felt about this movie.Performances by Brendon Fraser, Sadie Sink and Hong Chau were absolutely fantastic. But that's something almost everyone knew even before going in. What really touched me was the detailing through which they showed why each character behaves in certain ways and how everything ended up this way. The absolute helplessness of humans under a system and subsystems across various levels of power that are meant to make life better creates more obstacles for everyone involved are arguably the root of the evils here. But the way each person deals with the evils they face is entirely different even when those reactions have so much in common. That is really reflected in each of the performances. Each of them shows a variety of emotions that are so humane and makes your heart break even more with the contrast between their philosophies on life and how life treats them.For me, the film wanted to tell us that everyone is flawed, but it's the authenticity that should matter more than anything else which should be the road to happiness in life.",9/10
The Whale (2022),I got to screen this film for awards season purposes.It was very hard not to cry during several scenes.Branden Fraser is simply amazing. Under direction of Aronofsky it's probably the best dramatic film of the year.Fraser portrays the role to perfection. You feel sorrow for his character. The lady from Stranger Things that plays his daughter he is trying to reconnect with is going to be a huge star.There is nothing unlikable about this film. Fraser tugs at your heart strings with the struggles his character goes through.It's almost hard to watch at certain points in film; I had to take several breaks it's very emotional.Fraser is a very genuine guy in real life I have met him twice a decade apart and he was the same amazing guy.I hope this film does very well and ushers back a long awaited revival for Mr Fraser in Hollywood.Brilliant actor & film.10/10.,10/10
The Whale (2022),"Darren Aronofsky surprised me with this film as he kept the characters and their reactions to circumstances as the center of what's happening on screen.What was further surprising to me was the thorough nuance with which the film's sensitive themes are explored. Aronofsky is not a subtle filmmaker, but each of these characters is given such satisfying depth and is portrayed with their flawed perspectives and endearing desires on full display.The film has no hero or villain. Everyone is made out to be both to an extent and it's heart-wrenching to come to know these people throughout the film and watch them seek redemption.Some have criticised the screenplay as melodramatic-I didn't find this to be the case. I found it largely authentic, tragic, and full of intrigue that compounds as more information is revealed.My only glaring issue with the film is that one of the characters starts out as complex and with a singular nature, only to have that completely altered, oversimplified, and abandoned in his final scene. It seemed to me that this was done for the sake of the desired themes but at the expense of the character.But Brendan Fraser's performance alone marks this film as a colossal triumph, and there is much excellence to be seen throughout its entirety.",9/10
The Whale (2022),"While the title itself would be a pejorative for someone morbidly obese, it really ties into a story that the lead character Charlie holds dear to his failing heart. That is the story of ""Moby Dick"" Though the tale itself doesn't really come into play, if not for only the last great memory he has is of the sea and of a daughter that he had abandoned when he feel in love with someone of the same sex.Much has been said about Brendan Fraser's performance, and I couldn't agree more with the accolades he will get. As he is someone who is playing someone so uncomfortable in his skin, Fraser seems entirely wrapped up into the man's eat-to-death skin. And as someone who has had friends who are delusional when it comes to self-awareness of excess weight, the character of Charlie REALLY knows he is done with life. When he is reunited with his really estranged daughter, there is so much anger and resentment built up, you can feel the ugliness of family and the ability for them to destroy your insides. But Charlie doesn't take it to heart after all, he is the catalyst for the well earned disgust and hate. Hard to hammer on a guy who knows life has him beat. He is also doted on by his life partner's sister who seems to be both a caretaker and an enabler. She is played by Hong Chau, who brings so much connection to Charlie's lot in life. She both understands and has to standby as he self-destructs. This is very similar to the Elisabeth Shue character in ""Leaving Las Vegas""This movie is not for everyone. People who have suffered abandonment and require easy answers isn't going to get it fully. There is no forgiveness for Charlie. Though he isn't exactly clamoring for it either. He wants to do the right thing, and tends to annoy people with his optimism despite his physical ailments. At a certain point one has to allow the person to go unto the inevitable end. Is this love? Not quite. Nor has he ever gotten it. But for a movie that relies on the past and history and family dynamics to guide the emotions involved here, a little background may have helped. Perhaps Charlie's own childhood would be a window into his self-destruction. Instead, the audience needs to piece together, perhaps, the backstory from scant clues.A one location drama is a remarkable feat we should all celebrate. ""Who's Afraid Of Virginia Wolf?"" blows any of them away. But director Darren Aronofsky does wonders with an isolated Idaho apartment. As if the outside world is as bleak as the one he is entombed in. The story of Charlie and his ultimate future is what should keep you watching. For others who require a lot of action, this is not for you. It is a quiet piece that Fraser absolutely nails through gestures and emotions. Some have criticized this movie for exploiting an obese person. At moments I felt the pity come through. But the wise decision was to make Charlie seem at peace with his decisions he's made, though still disappointed. What lifts him to the resolution we want comes from him coming to terms with his relationship with his daughter. But also, a incredibly uncomfortable moment with his ex-wife (nearly unrecognizable Samantha Morton) who has fallen into the bottle yet still holds warmth for Charlie.People aren't going to like how the world caters to Charlie. It could be uncomfortably funny as in ""The Simpsons"" where Homer gets morbidly obese to get to work from home. There is no motivation here for that. He is a recluse who enjoys the occasional visit and sometimes self-pity. And that will turn many people off.I wish there was a happier ending. But that's not what you go to an Aronofsky movie for. Not sure what this is trying to fully say. Perhaps...we make decisions in our lives that sometimes we can't repair, but the other person needs to know they tried? Maybe. It's a tricky line that isn't going to sit well with everyone. I happened to appreciate it. Maybe you will too.",7/10
The Whale (2022),"The film presents a week in the life of a severely obese English teacher named Charlie, from Monday to Friday. By late Monday morning I was already crying hot tears in my seat, while other, more daring viewers trudged through mid-week before giving in. Brendan Fraser's beautiful performance holds the film together and gives it all its power, in a role that I hope will bring him the recognition he deserves. All the rest of the cast also does an excellent job. It is a striking and thought-provoking film, so much so that days later I am still reminded of excerpts from the much-discussed thesis, the absolute protagonist in the film's final insane ten minutes.",9/10
The Whale (2022),"See The Whale just to watch consummate actors, Branden Fraser and Sadie Sink, playing father and daughter, furiously catch up with each other after years of separation. Set in Charlie's apartment, just big enough for his morbidly huge body, The Whale is not only about the reconciliation of this odd couple and the survival of obese Charlie but rather about how obsession can consume faster than a greasy piece of pizza.Besides his abuse of food, Charlie refuses to let the Zoomed-in students see him in his rolling flesh. Yet, he is not self-centered or food-obsessed enough not to care about others, especially his flinty daughter, Ellie (Sadie Sink, so much like a young Ellen Page), for whom he writes college essays (he teaches writing) and saves for her over $100K. His heart is as big, well, as his body.Writer Samuel D. Hunter (also author of the play) and director Darren Aronofsky move Charlie toward either reclamation or death; they remind us he did abandon normal life for a gay love, who eventually committed suicide, and over whom Charlie has not recovered. Good enough for Charlie to despair and abandon himself to food.Ellie's finishing high school is Charlie's other obsession, and whether or not they all can survive their confrontation is the abiding suspense. Pervading the drama is a sense of regret in almost every character except maybe the pizza delivery boy, Dan (Sathya Sridharan). Even Charlie's ex, Mary (excellent Samantha Morton), suffers the sorrows of their split family.Hong Chau, who has had a great year, if only for her role in Triangle of Sadness, plays the gritty Liz, a caretaker for Charlie and true friend, regretting Charlie's descent that allows no trips to the hospital and hides his money for his unstable daughter.The itinerant Jesus fan, Thomas (Ty Simpkins), is food for another essay but for now an effective emblem of the intricate characters supporting Charlie's journey. Herman Melville lends figurative richness to the proceedings. If I haven't convinced you of the gold in this small film about a big man, go see it to witness my prediction that Fraser will win Globes and Oscar.",9/10
The Whale (2022),"Brendan Fraser should win every award possible for his role in THE WHALE. This would have been a very easy role to stereotype, yet Fraser made it complex, compelling, full of vulnerability and heart. This film succeeds because of Fraser's performance.Otherwise the film struggled.WHAT WORKED:
Tonally it worked. It had a dark, dramatic feel, the eating scenes were hard to watch, because you felt the pain of the character. The Production Design also worked well. The relationship between Charlie and Liz was the most believable, compelling, and grounded. I also didn't mind the aspect ratio, a bold and jarring choice at first, but you quickly realize it makes Charlie seem bigger in the frame, and this also works. Sound design worked well and the score (though at times a bit too dramatic) also served the film.WHAT DIDN'T WORK:
Because it was based on a play it was filmed much like a play. The blocking was really distracting, characters would get up and walk two steps then turn around, making human actions and purpose a bit unbelievable. There was overacting and overly dramatic performances especially from Ellie and Mary. Ellie was supposed to be a hurt and broken teen, yet it was played one note, with the same intensity from beginning to end. With the exception of Ellie's last line ""Daddy!"" the entire time she's on screen the actress portrays the same over the top actions, lacking in subtlety, nuance and emotional range. Even Samantha Morton who I consider to be a fantastic actress has some moments where it feels overacted/over the top and disingenuous, which makes me wonder if it was directed this way (as a play might have been on a stage). The writing was also at times a problem. It was hard to believe character motivations at times for why they would do certain things. The character of Thomas's want didnt' see earned or strong enough, the main purpose of his existence in the story was to give Ellie a ""person to save"" but the continued appearance of Thomas's character felt unearned and at times unbelievable, and when his true mission is revealed it's not some big altering reveal, more of a forced, and lack-luster one. Overall, some script/story decisions felt forced and convenient. Compared to Aronovsky's Pi, Requiem for a Dream, and Black Swan, The Whale is forgettable, lacking that ""je ne sais quoi"" that exists in Aronovsky's earlier works. But all of that aside, BRAVO to Branden Fraser who deserves to bask in every glory for his stellar performance as Charlie.",7/10
The Whale (2022),"I was immersed into this film from start to finish. Darren Aronofsky directed a spellbinding emotional triumph in cinema The Whale deserves numerous awards mainly for Branden Frazier!

I hope Branden is ok this movie had of been difficult to make. A tour de force view of an obesity and bonding that is continuously top notch acted.

The Whale (2022),"The Whale, is not Free Willy, but an overweight English instructor, who eats to cure his depression. His students have no idea, until a reveal of what he looks like. Chalie, played greatly by Mr Brendan Fraser, stays inside all the time, is embarrassed by his weight, and leaves cash in mailbox for food delivery.Charlie has no friends, but, a care taker who is his only friend, and brings in food and supplies. We find that Charlie is stubborn; he refuses to go to the hospital having high blood pressure, stating he has no health insurance. ( We learn latter he has around $120,000 saved for his daughter.) The care taker, Liz, we find out is a enabler; bringing double cheese meat ball sandwiches, and other treats.The Whale is based on a play, yet works better as a play. The film more or less has two sets, living room, and bedroom. The film is more or less seen through Charlie's viewpoint. The camera does not leave the doorstep of the apartment. It just felt there was more that could have been focused on had Charlie left home.I didn't hate this film, but, I guess I went in with bigger expectations. The acting is phenomenal, but the 2nd act tended to get reparative fairly quick. I do hope Mr Fraser wins the Oscar, but, as a movie, it is good, but I did not leave the auditorium feeling "" wowed..""See it, but, I don't mean to come as harsh, but, it felt as if too much was edited out in final process as well.",6/10
The Whale (2022),"I had an incredibly hard time knowing what to write for this movie, but after giving it some long and hard thought, I'm torn. Brendan Fraser gives a career best performance and hits all the right notes, as does the rest of the cast. The issue for me was how the material was handled. I heard so many critics saying how ""kind"" and ""empathetic"" this movie was and how it was Aronofsky's first movie since The Wrestler to accomplish such a thing. The only thing I can say is that this movie is basically a carbon copy of The Wrestler, right down to the ending, but it was anything but empathetic and kind. Unfortunately, one of my biggest complaints of this movie was how mean spirited it was. The only kindness we really get is from Fraser's Charlie. Even Simpkin's ever sweet character succumbs to cruelty. I also understand that the filmmakers want so bad to show food as an addiction, but it got way too over the top. The whole movie, even down to the title, feels more or less like a sideshow attraction to Fraser's character. Plain and simple, it's as much a dramatic character story as it is a deeply cynical body horror film. I'm disappointed.C.",5/10
The Whale (2022),"This was truly an experience. I went into this with very high expectations and I can truly say they were exceeded.The acting was impeccable. I honestly think Brendan's performance may be the best performance by any actor that I have witnessed. If that statement isn't true, I can assure you that he brought the most emotion out of me than any other actor. Sadie Sink was also phenomenal here. I was blown away. Hong Chau, who I somehow didn't know before this, was also out of this world.As always, Darren makes the whole thing gorgeous to watch-even when the scenes are filling you with dread, disgust, pity, sadness, etc. I feel like this film made me feel every emotion I've ever felt. I absolutely do not want to see it again anytime soon. I drove home in silence and before long I was sobbing.I went to see this film alone for more than one reason-but mainly because I wanted to allow myself to feel my emotions in full (aka I wanted to allow myself to cry my eyes out, which I did). I reserved a great seat in the middle so I had a couple to my left and a couple to my right. Both right next to me. When this film ended, none of us made a sound or moved for at least 5 full minutes. I was the first to get up and leave. I've never experienced that before.This film is not an easy watch but it's an important one. 10/10.",10/10
The Whale (2022),Brendan Fraser has proved he still has it. It's a beautiful performance that's long overdue for him. A film that will make you cry and love Brendan. A must see. He has long been a fan favorite actor but this Blast from the Past will make you rethink his acting. A brilliant film that is a sneaky great film. If you are on the fence about seeing this you'll regret not seeing it. I felt a sense of sadness and love when watching this film and I cried many times. It's not a film that comes around 9ften but when it does it changes cinema. An Oscar contender film with real heart. The best film of 2022.,10/10
The Whale (2022),"I just got back from seeing this movie in theaters. I'm not sure what to say yet because I'm still feeling and processing everything I just watched. All I can say is the performances in this film were incredible all around. I was crying throughout the majority of the film because so much of what was depicted and described in the movie paralleled so many things that I have experienced in my own life. I only wish my dad could have seen this movie before he passed away last year, and that maybe we could have talked about it if we had been in touch the last couple of years. This movie probably will not affect everyone the same way but it definitely had an impact on me. I've never seen anything like this before. Ever.",10/10
The Whale (2022),"THE WHALE (2022) ***1/2 Brendan Fraser, Sadie Sinks, Ty Simpkins, Hong Chau, Samantha Morton. Fraser gives a career high performance of depth and heartbreak as an obese man attempting redemption in rekindling his relationship with his estranged teenage daughter (Sinks all seething contempt) before his health completely betrays him. Filmmaker Darren Aronofsky's adaptation of Samuel D. Hunter's play plumbs the depths of humanity and allows his star to shine buried under a mountain of prosthetics by Adrien Morot in a tightrope act of what could've been a disdainful freak show or worse a melodramatic mess.",8/10
The Whale (2022),"I looooved this movie. It is clearly based on a play, and if you can accept that from the start and just take it all in, this movie really takes you into emotional spaces i didn't expect.At some parts I admittedly laughed when I shouldn't but when the film reaches culmination it's impossible to not be taken by the beautiful agony of this tale.This will win a best lead Oscar and bc Aranofsky used so much restraint I suspect he will be snubbed but as with all his films I guarantee you wont be able to shake this movie off.This is legit art and it will make you uncomfortable, but unlike Mother -- it will be totally justified in the end.",8/10
The Whale (2022),"I want to think maybe high expectations hurt my perception of this movie, but honestly I don't know if I would've liked it anymore had I known nothing about it.I think that it had so much potential, but fell flat with the storyline. His daughter who he hasn't seen in 9 years he reaches out to because he thinks he is dying and when she arrives it is kind of like she hadn't seen him for a week. I know her character was supposed to be unlikeable but her character had really no depth, just hateful and mean. They could've added more to her understandably let down and abandoned personality. That's kind of how I felt about everything though. Maybe had there been flashbacks of Brendan's character younger with his partner, delving into their relationship more or his struggle with mental health or the period when he chose to leave his family....there wasn't enough depth to any of that. No connection to his partner and what lead him to what he became. I wanted to connect more with this story, I wanted to feel more his past that lead him to his miserable future.I'm also not saying Brendan's performance wasn't good, but I'm not sure I felt it was Oscar worthy. I don't know, I wanted to cry, I wanted to feel it, I wanted the ""life is so short and what you make of it feeling"" before heading into this New Year, but it just wasn't there for me. And I was bummed.",6/10
The Whale (2022),"I'm not an emotional person per se, but I tried really hard to keep myself together, but Brendan Fraser nearly makes this impossible in the last 10mins of this movie! Having writer Samuel D. Hunter at the screening made this even more emotional and touching and he so deserves an adapted screenplay Oscar for this.@TheAcademy: This is an incredible year with incredible movies and performances. I think NOW it's the perfect time to make a one in a lifetime exception and give an Oscar to Austin Butler AND Brendan Fraser - they both deserve this by such gripping and well played performances...but I digress, You want to hear about the movie....Sometimes a movie comes out at the write time and post all the C19 isolation, this movie might actually hit more people than it would have done before, and that is a good thing!This movie is written in such a beautiful manner that it instantly should become a classic of our times. The even more beautiful part here is, that it also relates to a classic, by referencing Moby Dick a lot and this makes you (re-)think and put it all into perspective.You like Max in Stranger things? Excellent, Sadie Sink does such a good job that you can't feel anything but despite and hate for her character. Hong Chau also does great work and delivers probably the best performance of her career here, I would love to see her rewarded for this with at least a nomination.This movie will take you onto a boat, sometimes the waves will hit it hard and it gets rocky, sometimes the quietness of the sea let's you reflect on the bigger picture. Just remember...Don't judge a book by it's cover, or it's descriptions of whales.",9/10
The Whale (2022),"I found this film quite depressing. A morbidly obese man living out his last days wheezing and moaning. The plot was not very compelling. It appears Charlie, an English teacher, was at one time married with a daughter. He left that behind 8 years prior after falling in love with a male student, abandoning his daughter. In those 8 years his gay lover it appears committed suicide, and as a result Charlie started eating himself to death. The timeline seems a little short for this progression to me. His daughter Ellie renters his life, and she is really an unlikeable, miserable person with zero redeeming qualities. Mixed in is also some sort of boy pretending to be a missionary??? He keeps coming back trying to save Charlie, but his back story is revealed and it makes little sense. Charlie is cared for by his ex lovers sister, a nurse that while caring for him, enables him to continue his slow suicide. None of these characters add much to the story, all are unlikeable. Brendan Frazier did a wonderful job playing this broken fat soul. That's about it. The movie itself was pretty lousy, the supporting characters were forgettable. I wouldn't say not to watch, but don't expect much other than being repulsed and depressed.",6/10
The Whale (2022),"Beautifully crafted, vulnerable, yet gripping. Extremely visceral from the get-go, starting with a memorable (and uncomfortable) first scene. It doesn't lose its grip on you until the touching, heart-wrenching end. The camera is very opinionated in showing you a POV and it's based on the screenwriter's own experience struggling to connect with a younger person whilst self-medicating through food. Critics please note - it's not a film about fat people or being fat. At it's heart, it's themes are quite deep - redemption, self loathing, emotional honesty, judgement from others and the struggle to find real connection. Incredible and challenging performances, especially from Brendan and Sadie.",10/10
The Whale (2022),"I saw ""The Whale"" yesterday starring Brendan Fraser as a morbidly obese man who is eating himself to death after the untimely death of his lover. It is directed by Darren Aronofsky from a play written by Samuel D. Hunter. So, the movie itself is a 3-act play filmed in Fraser's characters Idaho apartment. His only visitors are his nurse, his embittered daughter, a religious missionary boy hoping to convert him, his ex-wife, and his pizza delivery man who has come to know him by name. Fraser is buried under a fat suit simulating a 600-pound man. Many have praised Fraser's performance, and it is very good, but I don't think it is Oscar worthy. Working under heavy makeup is not an automatic Oscar nod IMHO. I was actually more impressed with the supporting players' performances, especially Sadie Sink as his daughter and Hong Chau as his long suffering but devoted nurse. I cannot give the movie my highest rating, but it is still recommended for fans of a well-acted drama in a confined setting. 7/10.",7/10
The Whale (2022),"A skinny heterosexual who leaves his wife and young daughter for another woman and then turns into a self-loathing house hermit because the girlfriend kills herself...not really the stuff that fills a theatre. But a grotesquely obese slob who watches gay porn and gorges himself until he vomits...now there's drama! Call me a curmudgeon, but I didn't buy any of it. The acting is great and I'd rate the movie a ""5"" for that alone, but long before the first hour was up, I was looking at my watch. The basic premise is worth a look, but the movie quickly reaches a point where it fails to draw you in, and the repetitive, freakshow nature of it all just grinds on and on.",5/10
Babylon (2022),"So many reviews praise this film for the level of ""debauchery"" shown in it or the devotion the actors gave to said debauchery. But just because you have the willingness to fill your film with an over excess of sex, drugs, violence, and human bodily fluids doesn't mean you have a good film. This movie feels like it goes on forever and has endless character who serve no real purpose to progressing the story. At the core there is a decent plot but it falls apart and some of the scenes feel like they were written by a teenage boy imagining what his ideal ""fantasy"" would play out like. This movie will easily become a cult classic just for how vulgar it is.",4/10
Babylon (2022),"Whether it be orgies, showcasing various bodily fluids, plot threads, or the runtime of the film, Damien Chazelle is fully unrestrained in his latest film. La La Land and Whiplash are some of my favorite films and I'm a big fan of Chazelle's directorial style. He shows flashes of that brilliance often throughout Babylon, but does indulge in his most extreme tendencies as well in this modern Hollywood epic.There is a lot I liked here. The opening sequence is a sight to behold and had me mesmerized with its vibrant energy. The film chugs along at a good pace for the next two hours to the point I really didn't feel the runtime for most of it. It's the last hour or so where Chazelle loses the story a bit. There were several instances where I thought the film was over, but another scene would pop up next. The runtime really feels unnecessary and there's honestly whole plot lines that could be cut out that wouldn't affect the film.Justin Hurwitz has composed another terrific score (with some nice hints of La La Land) and the photography, costumes, and production design are all stellar. Outside of some shoddy editing, especially a bizarre movie montage at the end that really did not gel, the technical aspects of the film are quite an achievement.Chazelle really needed someone to tell him no with this film. Some better editing combined with some self-restraint and this would be much closer to the epic masterpiece status he's clearly aiming for. As it stands, it's a pretty entertaining tale of excess and fame in early years of Hollywood.",8/10
Babylon (2022),"This film felt like it was written and directed by a high school drama class kid with ADHD. It was exhausting to watch, and it was all over the place with too much filler, too many unnecessary sub-plots, convoluted scenes and dialogue, with horrible editing and scene start and cuts. In the hands of better more experienced filmmaker, this could've very easily been so much better and more enjoyable. Writer and director Damien Chazelle gave us a hack-job screenplay with overzealous and pointlessly outlandish scenes, that are all style with very little substance. The all star stellar cast were all amazing, especially Margot Robbie - who was the only reason I didn't stop watching 40+ mins into this utter disastrous nonsense. The critics got this one right. It's a very generous 6/10 from me, all going to the performances and decent cinematography.",6/10
Babylon (2022),"After an ""interesting"" opening scene about our main character Manny (Diego Calva) trying to get an elephant up to a party in Bel-Air, Babylon floors the gas pedal and barely comes up for air for the rest of the run time. I wanted to credit Damien Chazelle and his team for providing a unique experience in regards to pacing, setting and tone. The expression ""fever dream"" is overused but Babylon is captured in such a chaotic and constantly shifting way that kept me enraptured. The movie looks fantastic and even if you don't have an interest in this period of cinema, I don't doubt that Babylon will still pull you in. The costuming and sets are dynamic and show how disorganized and tumultuous early Hollywood was. I was hooked from the get-go and for all the movie's flaws, its presentation is vibrant and fast-moving to keep help you entertained.While Babylon is distinctive with its look and pacing, when it comes to the characters, things are a little more familiar. Conrad and LaRoy are loosely based on a couple of people from that era but the lessons the movie wants to teach us about Hollywood chewing up and spitting out talent are pretty routine. I think Babylon is effective at getting those across but I was a little let down that the movie starts so bombastically and then quietly tip toes into conventionality by the end. Some characters are meant to be less distinctive (Manny is the audience avatar for example) but while I wish they were a little more fresh, I did want to follow them throughout the length of the movie.Damien Chazelle has enough of a name now that he could probably get any actor/actress he wanted in his cast. He still attracted some big and interesting names for Babylon. I think every member of the main cast did a fantastic job and it's a credit to them and Chazelle for getting the most out of his performers. Brad Pitt's the biggest name and I really enjoyed the work he put in as Jack Conrad. He's appropriately funny in Conrad's lush and over-the-top behaviour but he garners some genuine sympathy for him when the world turns against him. Pitt could have played it so big that he came off as an entitled prick but there's some warmth and passion to Conrad and Pitt gets that across. I've always liked Margot Robbie and she's on point here as Nellie. She throws herself into it completely, there's a surprising amount of physicality and nuance in Nellie's whirlwind behaviour. Much like Pitt, she's really funny when she is given the opportunity to be. Despite the pretty telegraphed arc for her character, you understand why Manny can't resist Nellie even when it's crystal clear she's bad news wrapped in pretty packaging. I would hope that Pitt and Robbie both get awards consideration for their work here. Diego represents the audience, he's witnessing all the craziness and has to go along with it. He's a pretty blank slate but there's enough from Diego that his character is distinct and you understand his motivations. I want to credit Li Jun Li and Jovan Adepo as Lady Fay Zhu and Sidney Palmer respectively. Their characters are written with a heavy hand but both are sympathetic and have their respective moments. The oddest casting is Tobey Maguire as threatening mobster James McKay but Maguire's surprisingly good at being a creepy underworld figure.Getting to the negatives, Babylon is a movie that indulges in the exact same vices that it's lambasting. As a film, Babylon's determined to show all excess and hedonism of the era in all its ""glory."" I appreciated some of this but there are moments where the movie gets pretty gross (there's an early scene involving a elephant that is going to shock people) and while I get what Chazelle and his team are trying to show, was it really necessary? I'd argue not. Babylon's lengthy run time is also going to drive some people away but it also has an affect on how the story twists and turns. Characters that started out with more depth gradually turn more generic (Nellie specifically comes to mind) and you could have easily trimmed some of the fat off this movie. The total length of Babylon feels a little self-indulgent and while the previously mentioned frenetic pace keeps you guessing, it saps some of the ending's impact. I got what the movie was trying to say with its wrap-up but I can't deny I was bouncing in my seat in anticipation of getting to leave.Just like the lavish and insane partying that Babylon presents, you have to choose to take the hit of whatever your poison of choice is and dive in headfirst or not to indulge and slip out the back. Babylon is going to be an incredibly polarizing film and while I enjoyed large parts of this movie, there were also many scenes that fell flat for me. I'd grade Babylon somewhere between a 7 and an 8 but I'm rounding up because there are moments where Babylon has some real cinematic magic. I'm not comfortable wholesale recommending Babylon, if you're interested in a Wolf of Wall Street style comedy about the excess of Hollywood in the 1920s that gets pretty dark, check it out.",8/10
Babylon (2022),"In the opening scene of BABYLON an elephant on a pick-up empties its bowels over one of its handlers. This, I'm sorry to say, sets the tone for much of what follows. This is a long movie - three hours, much of which is crap.Writer/director Damien Chazelle, who gave us LA LA LAND a few years ago, turns the clock back to the 1920s when ""Hollywoodland"" was transitioning from silent pictures to sound. Brad Pitt and Margot Robbie play two leading actors who flounder during this period of adjustment, cast in a series of tawdry flops. Diego Calva and Jovan Adepo play a Mexican production assistant and a jazz trumpeter whose careers briefly flare. All four stars make the best of their roles despite the chaotic screenplay. Robbie's damaged character, a stock favorite, fueled by addiction to cocaine and gambling, is overdone and risks losing the viewer's sympathy.Orgiastic parties and a weird scene in a mountain torture palace presided over by Tobey Maguire in overdrive bring echoes of historic Babylon and some of the weirder extremes of early Hollywood. And there are many references to SINGING IN THE RAIN, that gem of a film set in the same era as this mash-up - one of the all-time greatest movies. With its messy script, erratic direction and uneven editing, BABYLON is in an altogether different league. I can't think of a picture I've hated as much as this. Sorry!",3/10
Babylon (2022),"As ""Babylon"" (2-22 release; 189 min) opens, we are in ""Bel Air, CA 1926"", and find ourselves at a massive and out-of-hand party, where sex and drugs are ""de rigueur"". Jack Conrad, a big movie star, becomes the center of the party upon his arrival. Also there is Nellie LaRoy, a beautiful and brash aspiring actress. Also there is Manuel Torres, who hopes to find a job in the movie industry. At this point we are 10 minutes into the film.Couple of comments: this is the latest from writer-producer=director Damien Chazelle. Let me admit up front that I absolutely LOVED all three of his prior movies (""Whiplash"", ""La La Land"", and ""First Man""). Hence I went into this film with high expectations. Alas, I shouldn't have. ""Babylon"" certainly is well done from a technical perspective (photography, editing, musical score), but it misfires badly from a substantive perspective. The storyline is supposed to show us how Hollywood's transition from silent films into talkies was a success for some and a disaster for others. But what we get to see here is a self-indulgent, unfocused, and over-long movie, torpedoed by its weak script. (Can someone please tell me what the point of the snake fight scene was? Or of the freak show towards the end of the film? And that's just naming those two). The all-star cast certainly gives its best shot with the weak material that they are given, but in the end this film cannot be saved. This is 3+ hours of my live I'm never getting back.""Babylon"" was supposed to be released a year ago, but COVID had other ideas. It was just released in US theaters this past weekend, and vastly underperformed at the box office. Let's just say it as it is: it tanked. The Tuesday early evening screening where I saw this at my local arthouse theater here in Cincinnati was attended okay (I counted about 10 people). I cannot imagine that Babylon will have long legs at the box office, or that it will pick up a bunch of Oscar nominations. For that the movie is simply too weak, too long and over-indulgent for its own good. Of course don't take my word for it, so if you liked Chazelle's earlier films, I'd suggest you check this out (albeit with low expectations), and draw your own expectation.",3/10
Babylon (2022),"My main takeaway when I left the theater this evening after watching this film, was that it was far too long and had probably one storyline too many to make this movie fly, but instead after the first act, it drags, and drags, and drags.The funny thing is, the best moments of this film are within the first hour. The less cohesive and more chaotic the film was, the more exciting it felt. After that point though, the film falls apart, the plotlines stray and the film has maybe 50% of the crazy energy that the first third had. It attempts to try and regain that energy in the finale, but doesn't quite capture what came before it. It turns from debauchery to horror, and it didn't gel well for me. Felt like the tone contradicted itself from where it began.The acting on the other hand is fantastic. Robbie and Pitt are electric, and the way Diego Calva can emote without saying anything is brilliant. I just wished the script and direction from La La Land writer/director Damien Chazelle was as good as the acting. Sometimes, the film felt like I was watching four films at the same time. Each of these plotlines could have had their own movies and seeing them all jumbled together here felt self indulgent and exhausting by the end of it. Only one of the storylines have any sort of ending that makes it feel justified in it's telling. Afterward, when the credits start to roll, you're just sat there with no feeling for what you just witnessed for a little over three hours.Overall, I only recommend for people who don't mind the three hour runtime, but keep in mind that the films plot goes absolutely nowhere, and although it might be a fun trip at times, it is a rather pointless one.2 talking pictures out of 5.",4/10
Babylon (2022),"In the words of SuperHotFire, I'm about to end Damien Chazelle's whole career.Babylon is a preposterously bad movie. At the same it's an experience that you will remember for the rest of your life. It's aggressively vile. For the vast majority of three hours, you are locked in with this movie as it assaults you with graphic visual depictions of virtually every bodily function imaginable. Supposedly, this is a commentary on the evil, exploitative and corrupt studio system that destroyed old Hollywood. Damien Chazelle, having started his career planting a sloppy wet kiss on the industry with the maudlin, yet beautifully constructed La La Land comes back 6 years later with a film filled with nothing but hatred and anger. But at the same time, that's still not what Babylon wants to be. It wants to be an unforgettable epic. Chazelle wants to be mentioned in the same breath as Scorsese and P. T. Anderson. He wanted to make a film that sweepingly celebrates the beauty and horror of an American artistic movement. He's so emotionally invested as a Hollywood man that its driven him completely insane. Not since Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate has such a psychotic Hollywood movie been made. If it had just been a Molotov cocktail thrown at Hollywood, and nothing more, Babylon could have been a stroke of genius. Instead, it is so gluttonously self-indulgent and conceptually unstable, that I've lost any kind of respect that I may have had for Chazelle as a director before.Now let's take a step back. Are there any redeeming qualities about Babylon? Yes. Two scenes in particular showcase the immense skill that Chazelle still has as a director and offer glimpses of the kind of good movie Babylon could have been. The scene that details the grueling creation of the first talking movie is both hilarious and exhilarating in showing how impossible it was to work with the new technology. When the film points to the lengths at which Hollywood executives exploited their new silver screen stars through their race and gender, it offers a stunningly profound depiction of the emotional abuse that was inflicted on the actors. But all of that is buried under an avalanche of sophomoric pornography. When the characters aren't cursing like truck drivers, they are having ravenous sex or projectile vomiting, or urinating on each other. This film wants to be The Wolf of Wall Street, Boogie Nights and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas all at the same time. But it's none of those films. It is instead a fascinating race to the bottom. I can't say that I wasn't entertained by the experience. I was wildly amused by it, in fact. But I also felt dirty as I walked out of the theater seeing this. Only see this film if you are with an audience of people who are blacked-out drunk or so high that they cover the screen with pot smoke. I'd assume that would be a blast of an experience.",3/10
Babylon (2022),"I've seen all four of Damien Chazelle's movies; none has struck me as especially satisfying. This one, all three joyless hours of it, gave me barely a moment of pleasure. It's a perfect example of -- in a phrase often used by Esquire -- ""wretched excess.""It purports to be, in part, that rather trite creation, ""a love letter to the movies,"" but spends most of its time trashing Hollywood as a pit of debauchery -- a slander that never feels remotely authentic (even though I was raised on Kenneth Anger's ""Hollywood Babylon""). The film titillates us with pulp-magazine fantasies of subterranean caverns outside the city where, by torchlight, jaded Angelenos gaze at torture, rat-swallowing, and other depraved acts. Its cast of characters -- the overprivileged fading film star, the shallow, wildly hedonistic sexpot heroine, the loyal, upright Mexican immigrant, the cynical gossip columnist, the passel of ludicrously snooty L. A. millionaires and their catty wives -- all felt like old cartoons. Even the crowd at the protracted orgy that opens the movie felt choreographed and utterly fake: frenetically cheering, dancing, and gesticulating at times in a caricature of Hieronymus Bosch, the next moment transformed into a sedate, respectful nightclub audience as silent as a library.I did appreciate the music in this film, as well as the decor, the hundreds of extras, and the constantly moving camera. But ultimately I think Chezelle was provided with way too large a budget and simply squandered it.",4/10
Babylon (2022),"Given that ""Whiplash"" and ""La La Land"" were outstanding films, it seemed reasonable to hope-and expect-that director Damien Chazelle's new film would deliver. It seemed to be a unique spectacle of excess and debauchery in 1920s Hollywood that would combine flashiness with, hopefully and given Chazelle's previous track record, a compelling story and profound character development. Tragically, however, ""Babylon"" is a bloated misfire that ends up being unique for all the wrong reasons.Right off the bat, Chazelle brings the viewer along for a ride that ends up being a fusillade of pulse-pounding jazz music, a whirlwind of hedonism, and increasingly sophomoric and eye-rolling moments. This would have all been fine if he had a more coherent story or contextual justification for his indulgence, but alas, he doesn't. After all, some exceptionally well-directed films such as Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"" (or even ""The Wolf of Wall Street"") or Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"" completely wrap themselves around a crackerjack, virtuoso sense of intensity while simultaneously complementing their own narratives. Unfortunately, ""Babylon"" does not do the same. The debauchery starts to get increasingly tiring after a while when the characters doing it are thinly written (especially by Chazelle standards) and uninteresting, in contrast to better films about excess that keep the viewer wholly engaged over a long runtime. The film's plot is pretty loose and unengaging for a gargantuan 189-minute runtime, which does not help matters much either. The performances are fine but unexceptional, yet even the more talented actors in the cast can't elevate the disappointing and sometimes-pointless screenwriting they've been given to work with. The result is a movie that feels far less satisfying and impactful than it should have, especially since its many moving parts don't really add up to anything. Even the film's message about the ""magic of cinema"" comes off as a bit hollow given that many far better films have dealt with that topic.I hope Chazelle's next film will be stronger than this one, and something I will be eagerly awaiting. Given some of his previous works, he is certainly and clearly qualified of making great films. Unfortunately, ""Babylon"" isn't one of them. 4/10.",4/10
Babylon (2022),"It's 1926 Hollywood. The silent movie era is having a party of epic debauchery. Manny Torres (Diego Calva) is the 'Mexican' fixer servant doing all the dirty jobs. Jack Conrad (Brad Pitt) is the big movie star. Nellie LaRoy (Margot Robbie) is the flamboyant nobody who fakes it until she makes it. She makes it and then the silent era ends. Everybody works to master the new sound era.This is not an appealing start. I don't know what's happening with every Oscar bait movie which insists on an overly broad comedic scene with bodily functions. The elephant is completely overboard. I wouldn't open with that scene. It's an indication of what's to come. This movie is desperately trying too hard.I guess we're supposed to root for Margot Robbie, but I don't. I find her abrasive and not always appealing. She does find her tragic heartbreaks and that helps her character. This would work better if it concentrated more on Brad Pitt's character. He has some of best heart-felt scenes during his climax. Manny Torres is probably the other main character with a big character arc. I like the character, but the performance is too stoic. I need a different performance from him.Besides Brad Pitt's character arc, I love the general premise of redoing ""Singin' in the Rain"". It's a great premise that needs a little foreshadowing and less outrageousness. It could be a simple modern day revival with admiring fans watching ""Singin' in the Rain"" to open this movie. Damien Chazelle is just trying too hard. It hits a few false notes and the whole enterprise stumbles. It always gets back up with some very compelling scenes. For example, the first sound shot is fun. I don't like how it ends. Damien keeps pushing the comedy one step too far. I do appreciate the overall premise and the ambition of the work.",6/10
Babylon (2022),Oh my God I could not make it through 1/3 of this movie. After 20 minutes I felt like I have been watching for an hour and a half only to be disappointed that I had two hours plus to watch. The insanity of this is made up Hollywood world is just way too much to take and way too much to be enjoyable for someone trying to watch a movie. You can only fill a movie with so many stars and have it have no plot and so much spasmatic energy that it becomes just unwatchable. Maybe it's because I'm in my 40s and I don't care to hear so much blaring screaming and absolute chaos just to make a film seem like it's an art. Skip this.,2/10
Babylon (2022),"Greetings again from the darkness. It's 1926 and a movie mogul is planning yet another massive debauchery-filled industry party at his palace of a home in still-developing Bel-Air, California. Lest we have any doubt that this party is over-the-top, we are forced to witness the handlers of the main attraction - a circus elephant - get sprayed from the wrong end as they push the colossal beast up the hill. Once the party starts, things get even crazier. Orgies, drugs, nudity, wild dancing, and a golden shower and drug overdose in the room of a Fatty Arbuckle type ... yes, this opening party sequence lasts 20-30 minutes, and occurs before the opening credits. The only touch of class is the old school Paramount logo.Writer-director Damien Chazelle (Oscar winner, LA LA LAND, 2016) sets the stage for his wild and frenzied epic meant (I think) as a tribute to early Hollywood and the uneasy transition from silent films to talkies. Of course, that topic has been handled in other prestige films - recently with THE ARTIST (2011), as well as the classic SINGIN' IN THE RAIN (1952). It's the latter which serves as a template or guidepost for Chazelle, to such an extent that he shows clips from it, quotes it, and even has a couple of his characters share similarities with Lina Lamont and Don Lockwood.From the moment she crashes onto the party scene, this becomes Margot Robbie's movie. Fully engaged doesn't begin to describe how she embodies the Nellie LaRoy character. Nellie is a displaced Jersey girl desperate to break into showbiz, and she pursues stardom with everything she has to offer. Nellie is a risk-taker and literal gambler, and the character is supposedly inspired by the infamous Clara Bow. It's at that first wild party where she meets both Jack Conrad (Oscar winner Brad Pitt) and Manny Torres (Diego Calva). Conrad is a huge silent movie star, and also a boozing womanizer with the accompanying swagger (supposedly based on actor John Gilbert). Manny, though a much quieter soul, is much like Nellie in that his ambition is to work in the movie business. The two discuss their dreams while tearing into mounds of cocaine.Nellie's fearlessness in front of the camera (much like Ms. Robbie's) pays off as the offers roll in and she makes her name. She and Manny periodically cross paths as he climbs the ladder towards studio executive. We also keep up with Jack Conrad and his stream of wives, and how things begin to change with THE JAZZ SINGER and the advent of talking motion pictures. While all this is happening, the film also (sorta) follows the career of jazz trumpeter Sidney Powell (Jovan Adepo) as he builds a career as a black performer on screen. One of the more interesting characters who we wish had more screen time is Lady Fay (played by Li Jun Li). We are rarely treated to a Chinese lesbian chanteuse, and she makes each of her scenes quite fascinating.Others in the cast include Olivia Wilde as one of Jack Conrad's many wives, Lukas Haas as an industry guy, Eric Roberts as Nellie's hustler dad, Pat Skipper as William Randolph Hearst, and Max Minghella as the legendary Irving Thalberg. They are each fine, but none as memorable as Tobey Maguire (also a producer on the film), who has a funny/creepy cameo as a fictional giggling gangster named James McKay. However, it's Jean Smart as Elinor St John, a gossip columnist in the mold of Hedda Hopper and Louella Parsons, who has the film's best scene when she deals the hard truth to Jack Conrad. Ms. Smart seems to excel in every role she takes these days, and this may be one of her best, albeit with limited screen time.The issues with the film have nothing to do with its entertainment value and outrageous moments or with the performances. Each of those things keep us watching. It's only when we stop and think about it when the problems come into focus. Most blatant is the love story between Manny and Nellie. They actually spend very little time together after their cocaine feast. Certainly not enough to fall in love. There is a 'blackface' scene unlike anything you've seen before, and in 3 hours and 8 minutes director Chazelle follows up the projectile elephant poop with vomit from a drug overdose, vomit from something other than a drug overdose, a urine stream, and rattlesnake venom. At times it seems like he wanted to see just how much he could get away with.Chazelle collaborators from LA LA LAND include cinematographer Linus Sandgren composer Justin Hurwitz, and Film Editor Tom Cross, all three are Oscar winners from that film, and all provide superb work here. The technical aspects of the film are terrific, it's as a story (or stories) where things unravel. It's simply bloated and overly ambitious, while having some of the frenetic pacing of Baz Luhrman's MOULIN ROUGE! Or THE GREAT GATSBY. It appears filmmaker Chazelle is attempting to reinforce cinema is art as a spectacle, when most of us don't require more proof. The movie montage at the end is fun to watch, but strikes this viewer as a bit indulgent after a long movie. Buckle up for a wild ride and enjoy to good stuff.Opens in theaters on December 23, 2022.",7/10
Babylon (2022),"""Babylon"" tracks the career of Manny Torres, an aspiring filmmaker from Mexico who crosses paths with fellow aspiring starlet Nelly LaRoy at a bacchanalian party one night in 1920s Los Angeles. The film also follows several other characters at the same party, including movie star Jack Conrad, cabaret performer Fay Zhu, tabloid journalist Elinor St. John, and musician Sidney Palmer, as each rise and fall in their respective careers spanning the end of silent films and the beginning of sound productions; each of the characters cross paths throughout as they navigate the shifting business of Hollywood.This large-scale epic from Damien Chazelle is, in a word, ambitious, both in scope and mere technicality. It opens with an utterly ravishing, debaucherous party sequence that captures the maddening spirit of roaring twenties Hollywood, setting a visual bar that is fairly high. While there are a number of fantastic sequences throughout the film, this key party sequence where each of the characters are introduced/first intervene is, without a doubt, the highlight of the film. While its characters are fictional, the screenplay blends them in with passing names of real-life historical Hollywood figures, as well as thinly-veiled references to others.Firstly, it almost goes without saying that ""Babylon"" is gorgeously photographed. The performances are also uniformly solid. Diego Calva is a likable presence as the centerpiece character, while Margot Robbie's portrayal of the brash and troubled Jersey girl flying by the seat of her pants is comical and poignant by turns. Brad Pitt fittingly plays the drunken but goodhearted movie star, and Jean Smart is also a welcome presence as the curt and astute gossip columnist, ostensibly based on Louella Parsons (or a writer of her ilk).The film is consciously over the top, at many points capturing the madcap spirit of something the late Ken Russell would have directed. Its first three quarters are particularly outstanding, and demonstrate the realities (and technicalities) of how the transition from silent films to motion picture talkies posed legitimate, career-altering (or more often, career-destroying) challenges for nearly everyone who was part of the business. Chazelle projects this theme to the audience in one memorable and protracted sequence in which Robbie's character (along with the sound man) struggles, fails, is interrupted, and struggles again to perform a simple one-page scene. The nuts and bolts of these logistical challenges in a then-fledgling industry are perhaps the most intriguing components of the story, highlighting just how vastly different (and more arduous) the process was of making a sound picture for the actors and filmmakers accustomed to the established ways.By the time it reaches its final act, however, the viewer does get the sense that the project is beginning to implode under its own weight to some degree; the focus on certain characters ebbs and flows, and the film begins to lose some steam. It is revived somewhat by an insane sequence in which Torres and another crew member of his film studio (in an attempt to save LaRoy from reckless gambling decisions) cross paths with an eccentric crime boss played by Tobey Maguire, and journey into a subterranean gathering place for the city's debaucherous denizens, who have literally gone underground following the more reserved moral code of the 1930s. The garish and ghoulish sequence feels like a tour of Dante's Inferno (probably quite intentionally), and is almost more madcap than the opening party sequence.The film grinds to a somewhat abrupt halt as each of the characters' lives and careers face further significant devastation in the last thirty minutes, and the sense of tragedy that one might expect to feel is strangely absent, perhaps because these characters are in and of themselves larger than life, even cartoonish at times; still, I felt that there was an emotional core missing as their stories are resolved. The film ends on a profoundly cynical note, showing Hollywood as a place that metaphorically devours its own, only to be constantly replenished by the unending stream of those who make pilgrimage there, seeking to etch their mark in the tapestry of cinema. The observation is astute, and the implications are splashed across the screen in a century-spanning montage of snippets from the earliest films to contemporary ones.All in all, ""Babylon"" has many strong points: Mainly its visuals, sturdy performances, and focus on the industrial realities of early filmmaking that most 21st-century viewers would take for granted. It eventually grows a bit long in the tooth into its third hour, and loses some tenacity, but not enough so that the film entirely collapses in on itself (though it comes close). If nothing else, it earns its keep as an ambitious and scabrous love (and hate) letter to cinema. 8/10.",8/10
Babylon (2022),"Babylon is a long, messy, repulsive, and magnetic spectacle. Unfortunately despite the great performances and set pieces it doesn't live up to Chazelle's previous work.The movie wants to bring you down into the waste yard that is Hollywood then pull you out to see the beauty that grows out of the trash. The problem is the movie spends so much time in the mud, and goes so deep into it that by the time it tries to pull you out at the end it's too late.On the upside the cast are great and almost completely carry the movie, especially Margot Robbie's enthralling performance as Nellie. And as with Chazelle's previous work the set pieces are well executed and (some) characters are memorable.However, these positives could not completely overcome the movie's fundamental flaws which are -- going too far with trying to revolt the audience (to the point of childishness), not spending enough time with the characters or important scenes despite its decadent runtime, and the ending coming off as completely pretentious in the context of how practical/cynical everything leading up to it was.In the end, Babylon does serve its purpose as an entertaining spectacle, but like the Hollywood it critiques, its self-indulgence prevents it from achieving greatness.",7/10
Babylon (2022),I can see why the reviews are polarized and why people hate the film. It's a frustrating film at times mainly cause there is so much going on. Right off the bat it's crazy flash and busy tho I enjoyed it at first at the film progressed it gets more busy and busy and then the ending is so busy and goes on and on and on and it doesn't know when to end. That's the main fault of the film is that less is more and that would of helped the film. There is also much characters that the supporting characters don't get enough screen time and story that they seem pointless at times or lost. The acting is amazing especially Margot Robbie who deserves all the praise for the film. I get what the film was aiming at but it just lands where you hate or love it at times. It's frustrating and at times gives you a headache. I overall enjoyed the film at times and thought it was ok though I would not recommended the film.,5/10
Babylon (2022),"I gave up after the first hour. I have been a follower of movies from the 20's 30's and 40's and amateur film historian for over 45 years. This is supposed to be a tribute somehow? At least try to capture the spirit and style of the 20''s please. Music, dancing, clothing, mannerisms, speech- no effort made to recreate the actual era. Mini-Halter dresses worn with high heeled boots, table dancing like modern strippers flashing modern day panties. People shaking like they're at a Sex Pistols concert instead of actual dances that were popular like the Charleston. Yes, the 20's in Hollywood were a lot more decadent than anyone let on at the time but this is ridiculous . Characters supposedly based on John Gilbert, Anna May Wong, Clara Bow, a few references to other actual real life people and incidents, but to anyone that is a true fan of early Hollywood mostly a degrading, insulting, historically inaccurate. Also extremely boring.",1/10
Babylon (2022),"Babylon is cinematic marvel that Damien Chazelle is a messy, dazzling epic masterpiece that film hasn't yet accepted or had before. Damien Chazelle has called Babylon: ""A hate letter to Hollywood and a love letter to movies,"" but his messy, dazzling epic doesn't support that simplistic idea. Set in the early days of cinema, when talking pictures were a jaw-dropping phenomenon and Hollywood was still being created, Babylon suggests a deeper reality: the film industry's raw, self-destructive, narcissistic impulses and its glorious, magical results have always been opposite parts of the same whole. Chazelle's ambitions are huge. Babylon is full of remarkable set pieces with richly drawn characters, music, dancing, love and betrayal. The film's strengths more than make up for its serious flaws, including too many endings and a wrong-headed reliance on Singin' in the Rain as a touchstone. But if Babylon makes you groan occasionally, there are many more times long, exhilarating stretches that are mesmerising. In one of the film's multiple endings, which leaps ahead to 1952, a major character sits in a cinema tearfully watching Singin' in the Rain. That enamoured-of-movies scene hasn't been fresh since Sullivan's Travels in 1941, not to mention Cinema Paradiso in 1988 and this year's Empire of Light. The fact that the scene can be viewed as a homage to all those films doesn't make it less cliched. And a montage of other movies through history is a bravura but needless coda. At its best, Chazelle's film is a cinematic marvel, evidence enough that movies are magical, as it sweeps us into the beautiful, terrible world we recognise as Hollywood even now. The cast up and down Babylon is amazing and almost eerily in sync with my own tastes. Actors I deeply love, like Taylor Nichols and Ethan Suplee, show up oh-so-briefly as if casting director Francine Maisler had thumbed through my own mental rolodex and said to herself ""ah, here's another face Sonny would like to see."" This is, perhaps, another reason I found myself drawn in by Babylon's excess: I just liked spending time with almost everyone up on that big, beautiful screen, I fell in love with the cast and the story. Believing Babylon to be over, thus missing the last few of its 189 minutes. This was itself a fitting, almost serendipitous, way to end the movie. Audiences come and go; they are as ephemeral and ever-changing as the names on the marquee. The darkened theater filled with flickering light? That's eternal, everlasting, deathless. The actors and the audiences alike come and go, but the show goes on forever.",10/10
Babylon (2022),"Far too long, for the reward that it withholds, although it's fearless and adventurous, quite daring and quite bold, overflowing with depravity, full of wicked immorality, indulgence and degeneracy, quite an orgy that unfolds.The Roaring Twenties, and roaring doesn't quite capture the excesses presented here with a film that paints quite a colourful picture of the world of silent movies and their transition to the planet of sound. Margot Robbie smashes it out of the park, as well as producing voluminous amounts of vomit, however, take away the spectacle, and you're left with an often told tale you've seen many times before, and an eager anticipation to watch Singin' in the Rain for the nth time, a revisit your unlikely to make quite as often with this, as once is more than enough.",6/10
Babylon (2022),This movie shows how spoiled rotten actors are. They get paid massive amounts of money to pretend to be someone they are not. They drink and drug excessively. They have outrageous and decadent parties all the time. They have all the fame and fortune in the world and it's never enough for them. I honestly don't have too much sympathy for them in many ways. This movie has no actual plot. It's just spoiled actors acting like whiny children. It also is excessively long at over three hours of Hollywood psychosis.I for one don't worship actors like this movie wants me to. They aren't my gods. They are just people who get paid way too much for their profession. Hollywood was depraved back in the 20's and it still is now. I don't need to be reminded of that.,3/10
Babylon (2022),"SCORE: 2.0/10My brain hurts. Wow that was awful. I wouldn't even make my worst enemy have to sit and watch that for 3+ hours. Did some of the people who reviewed this take some of that stuff they kept showing throughout the film? That was a complete mess.It was just unorganized chaos. The only bright spot, if there was one, was Margot Robbie. I am in love with that woman. She was a part of some of the films best scenes, but there weren't many of those. No matter how amazing she was, I couldn't get over how terrible what I was watching was, with a plot that was all over the place and consistently boring.

I for one want STORY. Not just images trying to tell a story that comes up as empty and classless as this does. Babylon is living up to it's name in everything it threw at the camera in the first 30 minutes.I can live without all the big name stars and all the big grand cinematography if the story is good. If all I'm looking for is flashy picturesque wonder then I'd like this movie. But I'm not so it doesn't. And since I'm not, I wasn't interested in the story after getting through the introductions.

Babylon (2022),"Damian Chazelle doesn't make bad movies (whiplash, La La Land, First Man) but much of what I'd heard about Babylon in advance of seeing (no experiencing) it for myself was less than complimentary.Turgid, overlong, rambling, too strident and lacking a narrative.Well, in my view, all of those criticisms are both unfounded and unfair, because Babylon is magnificent.It's an epic story spanning thirty years, beginning in the silent era when Hollywood was in its most outrageous Klondike era.The talkies would pivot the narrative when Al Jolson's Jazz Singer arrived, but for now anything went and that's where the movie begins in a lavish set piece piece that starts with a scatalogical Elephant episode and culminates, some 25 minutes late, in a drug fuelled frenzy at the end of all parties.Then up comes the title credit, fully 25 minutes in.It's jaw dropping and hilarious.We then see the, also hilarious, growth of silent cinema where anyone with a mind, and a budget to do it, can do it. This is where Brad Pitt (a matinee idol in his final years) and Margot Robbie (a wannabe with talent and gumption) dominate proceedings with Robbie putting in a career high performance.In the third act the story slows down considerably and assumes a narrative direction before all hell breaks loose in the penultimate chapter (it turns into a horror film, with a stand out cameo from Toby MaGuire, that morphs into a psychedelic episode that Kubrick would have loved, before reaching its Jazzy musical finale.It's three hours of endless ideas, superb styling, sets and costume design.In using Singing In the Rain as a central plot device, and theme for the movie's funniest sequence on an early sound stage, Chazelle treats us to his first real exploration of humour.It's an homage, as the whole movie is, to the greatest days of hollywood. It's a comedy, a romance, a horror and a musical all rolled into one.And the music. On my, fans of La La Land will enjoy the musical themes that run throughout and are a direct follow up to his first masterpiece.I applauded the movie as the final curtain came down. It contains more ideas, more vitality, more chutzpah than anything I've seen for ages and I for one hope to see it rewarded at the Hollywood gongs night in the spring.Bravo.",9/10
Babylon (2022),"Damien Chazelle has chosen to tag along with the other filmmakers who decided to voice their opinions on the film industry, some flatteringly and some not so flatteringly. Chazelle, like Peele and the Cohen brothers, seems to deeply love cinema as an art, but does not like the crude and hypocritical mechanisms of the Hollywood system as much. In order to manifest this, he has decided to steal hand over fist from every film made since 1920, in a mosaic that cannot rival any of the sources he has been inspired by.Starting with the positive aspects, the film is undoubtedly made with great technical skill, and with an excellent use of sound. The settings are very beautiful. In particular, the parts devoted to the making of the films on the sets are extraordinary (the first in connection to the shooting of silent films, the second to the advent of sound), so much so that I would gladly have watched three hours of just those. Unfortunately, even these scenes look like they came from a Scorsese film, rather than a Chazelle one. The discussion of technological evolution is also a good foundation, and it is made explicit in the movie itself how it has already been the subject of other pictures that have made cinematic history (including the oft-mentioned Singing in the Rain).Everything else is disappointing. The screenplay appears sketchy on the basis of a good starting idea, and the characters who inhabit it are little more than macchiettes. Margot Robbie's character looks like Harley Queen catapulted into 1920s Los Angeles, in a variant to whom a clumsy attempt is made to give depth, as in the mother scene. Brad Pitt's one seems forcefully extracted from a Tarantino movie. The only development for Manny's is the moment when he pulls back his hair to indicate how he has been corrupted by the system. All the others are equally flat. What should shock (or amuse) turns out to be vulgar and excessive (such as the vomit gag, or the elephant poop gag). The humor is boorish and insulting. Tobey Maguire would be a good addition if he were not another unnecessary character in an already overstretched and long picture. The costumes are another problem. Besides being inaccurate with the depicted times, they dress poorly, particularly Nellie.Finally, for what it is intended to be about the industry as a threat to art, I find it hypocritical to see it carried by a studio, and a director, from Hollywood itself. This, also considering how Babylon was evidently made for the purpose of appeasing the elite of critics and juries of major film awards. The world of global and independent cinema is so vast, that I find unfair the continuous depiction of artists subjugated to an industry in the name of art. Industry of which they could easily not be a part (as there are alternatives to Hollywood), this, however, at the price of giving up the visibility and status proper to a certain American way of making movies. The final sequence with stills from some famous films (such as Alien, Avatar, Jurassic Park, and Babylon itself, for God knows which reason), it's not only a shameless theft from Nuovo Cinema Paradiso, but it's also of incomprehensible stupidity.So while I love cinema, and while I am inclined to appreciate those who choose to make it their subject, I would love more a director who truly chose to put art first. That, and a willingness to create something beautiful and well made, and not yet another hypocritical project critical of the industry's denigration of art.",5/10
Knock at the Cabin (2023),"Knock at the Cabin (2023) is a new M. Night Shyamalan picture my wife and I caught at an A24 Advance Screening last night. The storyline follows two men and their daughter on vacation at a cabin in the woods. They are visited and captured by four individuals who come out of the woods with an ultimatum...one of the three must die at the hands of the other two or the world will end. As time runs down the family sees the death and destruction the visitors promised. Will the family let everyone die, will they save the world or is it all an elaborate game being played by four psychopaths?As previously referenced, this picture is directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Signs) and stars Dave Bautista (Guardians of the Galaxy), Rupert Grint (Harry Potter), Ben Aldridge (Our Girl), Nikki Amuka-Bird (Jupiter Ascending), Jonathan Groff (The Matrix: Resurrection) and Abby Quinn (After the Wedding).The storyline and characters in this picture had a lot of potential; but unfortunately, every situation is straightforward and predictable, all the way to the final scene. It's too bad because the cinematography and camera angles are very good and Dave Bautista delivers an outstanding performance. His character was easily my favorite. However, the characters backstories needed to be more developed, more like The Stand, before they all met at the cabin. I didn't really care what happened to those characters (the decisions were too easy to make for the family). The kill scenes themselves needed more gore and intensity. They definitely could have been better executed to highlight the situation the parents were in. The conclusion is straightforward and you know what's going to happen and how.Unfortunately, this movie needed more twists and turns, which is a strange problem for a M. Night Shyamalan movie to have. I would score this a 6/10 and recommend seeing it once.",6/10
Knock at the Cabin (2023),"I read the book this film is based on before watching it. The Cabin At the End of the World was a great book that really dives into the histories of the characters, the philosophy behind the choice, and it ended with an ambiguous ending, where you weren't sure who was right at the end.The movie was on par with The Last Airbender in how it took the source material and made a Wikipedia summary adaptation with poor dialogue, acting and an ending that missed the point. The only redeeming quality was Dave Bautista's performance. He really did a good job with the role of a giant with a heart of gold, who is forced to do something horrible. You can really see the sadness in his eyes, and his conviction that what he saw was true.M. Night needs to get help with his scripts. He just doesn't know what he's doing.",4/10

The twist was there was no twist. I didn't enjoy that. This movie tells you exactly what will happen from the start and that's that, so as long as you trust what they say, the film has zero impact whatsoever.

The concept of this movie is excellent. The directorial choices, the storyline, the decisions made by characters were to be honest with you kind of blah.

Knock at the Cabin (2023),"Tame and mild are not words I would use to describe any other Shyamalan movie. I don't understand why he takes this route with Knock at the Cabin. It's not restricted by a PG-13 rating like so many other horror movies from cowardly/greedy studios (looking at you M3gan). So why were there numerous times where this movie used strategies seen in PG-13 horror flicks? Every time there was anything close to violence or gore, the camera cuts away. I don't even know what caused this to get an R-rating.As for the movie itself, it's extremely boring and has very little of value. Nothing stands out. Nothing impressed me. The filmmaking is more than competent, but there is almost no intrigue in this story. And it's one of the preachiest movies I've seen in a long time.As someone who's been more patient than most with Shyamalan's flops, that patience is starting to dwindle. I'll always be grateful for movies like Unbreakable, Split, Signs and many others. But I hope he can get back on track soon. (1 viewing, opening Thursday UltraScreen 2/2/2023)",2/10

I mean, like most of M. Night Shyamalan's films, their too out there, slow & pretty boring. This film is no exception. The plot is simple the twist you could sort of see coming a mile a way & the action was very sparing & too few & far between.The pacing is bad, nearly 45 minutes in I looked at my watch. At 94 minutes, 1 hour & 34 minutes, this film is overly long for what it is. I also found the modern day sniping to be unnecessary along with the films underlying cryptic message about sacrifice. The repetitiveness got annoying & didn't once forward the plot or give us any idea on how the film was going to end.Overall, another horror that falls flat on it's face. Can't we just have decent straight forward horrors with no modern day drivel added in? Not to mention a film that doesn't have a weird plot with poor pacing & a off runtime? I don't know.

Knock at the Cabin (2023),"In a world of sequels and IP M. Night Shyamalan continues to give us interesting and original stories. And he tends to get a lot of flack for them sadly. People want original content but then destroy it every time it comes along. It's no wonder we can't have nice things. 'Knock at the Cabin' isn't perfect, but it's certainly a fun ride.The film starts out as a mystery. We don't know what is going on and everything seems very strange and is not making a lot of sense. It's a good way to start a movie. Then we are let in on what is going on and things become particularly interesting. It's at this point that you simply must turn your brain off to logic to get through the rest of the film. Because much like a lot of religion it doesn't make a lick of sense.Where the film let me down was the ending. The book has such a thought-provoking and interesting ending. To get the movie made they were obviously told they would have to change that. It's very disappointing but it's sadly where we are in the world of film.

The only downside is, that one must take a life, as the big cheese wants to instil grief and strife, but there can be no selfishness, someone else must take the stress, before the human race, becomes a lot less rife.While films like this might provoke a bit of conversation in the pub about what you might or might not do in similar circumstances, it should also leave you on the edge of your seat, heart pounding and left dangling as the tension builds and the reality or otherwise escalates exponentially to an incredible, unpredictable climax; sadly however, you get none of that, which leaves it little more than a forgettable addition to the director's expanding list of previous near misses.",4/10

Knock at the Cabin (2023),"Okay, Streamers, I know we all have been waiting on pins and needles for M. Night Shyamalan's next feature film, and it's finally here. Oh, was that only me? Okay, then... Anway, I was anticipating Knock at the Cabin since I saw the first trailer last fall. Home invasion and the end of the world movies build on reasonable fears that many people have, so let's see what Shyamalan was able to do with the mix of these two.Knock at the Cabin is based on a novel by Paul Tremblay, ""The Cabin at the End of the World."" Shyamalan and his co-writers have adapted that novel into this movie. The basic premise is that a gay couple and their adopted daughter are on a vacation in a remote cabin in Pennsylvania when four strangers come to the cabin and tell them that the world will end unless they decide to sacrifice one of their own. It's a moral dilemma - kill someone you love in order to save billions of people you don't even know. What would you do if these hijinks ensue.Here's the thing - the premise of this movie is very interesting. It immediately makes the audience question what decision they would make and what questions they would ask if put in this situation. In that way, the movie easily grabs you. The problem is that Shyamalan doesn't do much more than pose the question and go through the motions of telling you what these guys do. It gets repetitive and there isn't enough development of the gay couple as characters to help the audience care about them or why they make the decisions they make. Therefore, the movie becomes pretty frustrating and unsatisfying.On the other hand, there are some good aspects. Dave Bautista, who plays one of the strangers, Leonard, is an inviting presence on screen. He can be menacing by his sheer size, but his performance ably fights against first impressions. Rupert Grint, who play another stranger, Redmond, brings a bit of dark humor. He's probably the scariest of the strangers. I'll also mention that even though I don't believe they are well-developed characters, Ben Aldridge and Jonathan Groff, who play the gay couple, Eric and Andrew, have good chemistry and react appropriately in this situation. I'll also say that no one does anything really dumb in this movie, which typically happens in these home invasion movies. Eric and Andrew, generally, make smart decisions to help protect each other and their daughter. So, the movie isn't frustrating because anyone is dumb.I also don't know why this movie is rated R. There isn't really any gore. There isn't anything visually scary about it. There may be some curse words, but I can't imagine they were enough to justify this not being PG-13.In conclusion, Knock at the Cabin is a decent entry in the Shyamalan filmography. It is not one of his best, but it also certainly not one of the worst. There is a good premise, but the movie doesn't do anything more than present it as a morality play, which eventually becomes repetitive. Although there are good performances, there isn't enough character development to sustain interest in these individuals. Knock at the Cabin is only good enough for a handful of popcorn - there's no urgency to see this in a theater.",5/10
Knock at the Cabin (2023),So the film follows the book fairly literally. The horror is more intense in the book but I can accept that. The acting is fine. The book has obviously a lot more philosophical depth but that is hard to convey in a film.But why oh why is the ending changed to some feel good happy ending?!?!? The book had a nice open ending where they walked off into the forest and you didn't know if ithe end of the world stuff was real or not and that was just fine. Why does everything need to be Disney-fied these days? Can people really not cope anymore without happy endings that books need to be rehashed to make the masses feel good. Disappointed.,4/10
Knock at the Cabin (2023),"Shyamalan gets the most extremes sides far as reactions. People either love or hate his movies for his bizarre yet ambitious signature style. The fact that he approaches his films with a ""swing away"" attitude has gained my utmost respect since his mega hit Sixth Sense. Along the way there's been some strikeouts but within the last decade he's created a Renaissance for his films.This particular book adaptation is yet another hit, and will be sure to get people talking. The premise starts out rather straightforward and you quickly find out the stakes are high and massive. The story will grab hold of you and shake you to the core with twists that even though you know are coming will still be shocking even for M Night's catalogue.The acting is absolutely next level with Dave Bautista and Jonathan Groff putting in their raw emotions and prowess into every scene. They will make you feel the story relentlessly . The writing here is also relative and gutsy. The camerawork is as crisp as ever with fantastic wilderness settings and supreme angle work. The cgi for certain scenes used looks authentic and never cheap. The true standout has to once again be the leaps that the plot takes going into to daring territory . It never holds back which is commendable in a time like this.Overall I would easily say that this film will be looked at as one of his stronger ventures and is highly thought provoking to a point where you'll need a second viewing. It gives the classic Shyamalan wonder and curiosity that make him one of the most intriguing directors /story tellers of our time.",8/10
Knock at the Cabin (2023),"M. Night Shyamalan's Knock at the Cabin is a solid concept and is filled with thrilling suspense, however I just felt that there was something missing. The acting was particularly good with some breakout performances from Ben Aldridge and Kristen Cui. It was an aesthetically pleasing film which was also a plus, but it was the story that just didn't add up. I felt that I left the movie with more questions than answers and an overall feeling of un-fulfillment. I think that audiences will enjoy this film for the most part, but the potential for a more satisfying conclusion will leave viewers feeling disappointment in my opinion. Still worth watching though.",6/10
Knock at the Cabin (2023),"The last productions of Shyamalan really disappointed. This one dont do the exceptions sadly. What happened to that man who tried some things pretty original in term of cinematography, story and characters? This one feel like a waste of a time from beginning until the end. The story dont make any sense, the characters too and the writing fell apart. We have also the flashback that seem to give us a perspective of these two mans who adopted a young asian girl. I dont really felt the struggle of these two mans and find the flashback unnecessary and useless in term of the story and just give us a break in the action or an emotional moment. So the apocalypse is supposed to come and we saw that four people attack the young couple and made them forced to do a sacrifice to save the world. And for the entire movie it will be a try to escape, believe them? Or not? The movie dont have anything else to say. The psychology of the characters are completely gone and thats pretey unusual with Shyamalan. And at the end they will save the world by a sacrifice. That was pretty boring and hard to believe: it completely have non sense at all from the beginning until the end. The characters react pretty strangely ( the mentions of visions, make people believed them). I didnt get into the story from the beginning until the end. I dont know why people said it had a twist in the movie: i didnt see anything like this (we just understand that the four people were right about the apocalypse and the sacrifice). I didnt really understand the purpose of this movie at all. It was a huge disappointment for me.",5/10
Knock at the Cabin (2023),"I was expecting this film to be be good after watching the trailer but walked out disappointed. The film starts off with a young girl Wen (Kristen Cui) being questioned by a mysterious man Leonard. (Dave Bautista) Wen gets scared and runs to the cabin where her two dads Eric and Andrew (played by Jonathan Groff and Ben Aldridge) are to tell them not to open the door. Soon Leonard and three other strangers are banging on their door demanding to be let in. When they do get in they say that the world is about to end unless one of the parents or Wen dies. Thats the choice the family have to make who to sacrifice. The film starts well, and Dave Bautista puts in an impressive performance. Sadly, however with the film mainly being in the one room it becomes repetitive and boring. The ending is disappointing. Having read what happened in the book I can see why they didn't use that ending but it would have made for a more interesting ending. Like the film Old this was another disappointing film by M Night Shymalan.",4/10

Knock at the Cabin (2023),"I am a big fan of NS but I must admit I'm slowly starting to lose interest in his films as the writing is horrible.Apparently the book is very deep, philosophical and intricate yet the script story is so blasé and dull that a person actually started to snore in the theatre just 20 mins into the film. That is how lethargic the story is that it feels like a low budget cabin concept film with a stellar performance by Dave Bautista but that's about it.The cute little Asian daughter is also a highlight of the film yet her character brings little to the story.3 stars for Bautista and the cute Asian little girl.",3/10

The whole film is them talking with this couple.There is nothing scary, suspenseful, thought provoking or interesting in this film.

Knock at the Cabin (2023),"I am sorry but these rave reviews here and 75 people giving it 10 stars, must have seen a different film to me. There are no twists or turns, the film just keeps repeating itself. The basic premise is so stupid on of three people have to sacrifice themselves to save the world, we are given no context no idea of who has said ordained this. Is it god the devil who, and why this particular family, all the easily spotted red herrrings are here, setting up the family as a same sex family where one of the husbands has an horrific homophobic attack, he tries to lead us into a false assumption, as for the ending, the expected twist never arrived.

Knock at the Cabin (2023),"M Night Shyamalan's new outing is largely a bland affair, that tries to tick the boxes which we usually associate with the director but sadly apart from the performances, the film doesn't offer anything more. The pace is slow which again is the same with all of his films but this one is devoid of any twists. All that build up for the predictable end simply disappoints.A gay couple with their daughter are at a remote cabin in the woods on their vacation. 4 strangers show up with a crazy demand to save the world from the apocalypse. Though it is an interesting premise, the pay off is not there. The scares are zero, the intensity is missing. Despite this I have to give credit for those effective shot selection. It is not dialogue heavy, just that the scenes become monotonous soon and this one lacks standout scenes.Wait for a better Shyamalan movie continues.",4/10
Knock at the Cabin (2023),"Cabin who? Ya, it's all I got, and that's about as exciting as M. Night Shyamalan's Knock at the Cabin. The premise of the story was very intriguing, and the casting and performances - especially Bautista, were spot on. But Shyamalan's execution felt more like something you'd expect from an amateur filmmaker. His artistic attempts with all the off-center shots - such as an actors face in the bottom right corner of the entire screen, became annoying fast, especially when it came to the dramatic gore scenes, that seemed to be edited down for 10 year old viewers. Even the backstory of the two dads was boring and pretty much insignificant to the core premise of the film, especially when the narrative was based on ""pure love"". Ya, ok, nothing pure about those two in those backstories, that also lacked anything of substance to make me care for either dad. His screenplay lacked the creativity to give the viewer the thrills and shock-factor this film really needed to give it some bite. At least throw in a twist or two to offset the generic and predictable storytelling. Nevertheless, still a decent one-time watch, but could've easily been so much better.",7/10
Knock at the Cabin (2023),"I don't want to bash this and I actually hate that I didn't like it more. M night shyamalan is my all time favorite writer, director, producer.. I was very excited to see this and to add the amazing cast. Johnathan Geoff is also a favorite of mine and the fact that he let him sing in this was everything. The acting over all was so great in this. Big props to the little girl as well who really shined. However most of the movie happened in one room which made some of the story drag. There wasn't really a surprise or a twist like most of his movies. Very dooms day meets religious outlooks. Wasn't terrible but didn't live up to some of the greats he has made in the past. Not even a jump scare. I love when he adds the twists or a creepiness.",6/10
Knock at the Cabin (2023),"With a small, relatively unknown cast (other than Groff and Grint) and M. NIght Shyamalan as director, I was expecting a blockbuster. Nope. A lot of goers in the theater thought so, too with some walking out in the middle of it seated in front of us and not returning. It was a weird, unbelievable story to begin with and suspending disbelief didn't work, either. The whole premise was ludicrous. I never read the book this is based on but I don't think I have missed anything. The cute Oriental girl who played Wenling shows promise and kept a nice momentum going throughout the pace of the movie. I hope that she continues to act. But, she couldn't save this bad script. As far I'm concerned, they can try knocking on another cabin door where there's no one home, anyhow. Skip it.",4/10
Knock at the Cabin (2023),"Let's face, it at this point, Shylaman had been a hack for over a decade. This movie isn't esoteric, it's not misunderstood and it's not unique. The only thing Unique is the fact it was produced rather than simply throwing this pathetic screenplay into a furnace. Truthfully, outisde of a Sixth Sense and Split, Shylaman can simply not write a decent movie. You'll see the same fan boys that somehow gave Old a 10 singing the praises of this poorly written script. If you want to waste 2 hours of your life, fight off sleeping and waste fifty dollars to prove you're right. Be my guest, I was more fulfilled staying home and watching Sponge Bob reruns.",1/10
Knock at the Cabin (2023),"No bruce willis surprise folks. Here's the premise-would you sacrifice yourself or a member of your family to save humanity. If that's a dilemma for you, then have at it. Other wise not so much fun here. Four nut cases break into cabin and threaten family with this problem. Very violent and no place for children. Slow moving and repetitive. I like dave bautista, very good, and two gay actors play gay fathers. I kept thinking about the little girl actress in the film and how awful this must have been for her. Should a child be around this much violence. I know its just a movie, but. There really isn't much of an ending and certainly no ""twist or surprise"" that we are so used to. Quite disappointed.

Sharper (2023),"A stylish thriller that tries to mimic the style of an '80s David Mamet screenplay, but falls short in executing the tough-talking puzzle movie genre. The film follows the story of Tom, a soft-spoken young man played by Justice Smith, who falls for a beautiful woman named Sandra. But when Sandra reveals her brother is in trouble and needs a large sum of money, the story spirals into a series of cons and double-crosses.While the film is enjoyable to watch, with a succession of betrayals and twists, the story and characters are shallowly drawn and the dialogue falls short of elevating the film beyond its foundation. The film also tries to be too stylish, with a sleek production and lack of danger, missing the gritty feel that is essential for a successful thriller.Despite its flaws, ""Sharper"" is still a decent diversion for those who enjoy thrillers and the talented cast, especially newcomer Briana Middleton, delivers engaging performances. If you're looking for a movie that you can watch without too much thought and enjoy a series of twists, then ""Sharper"" is a good choice.",6/10
Sharper (2023),"I watch this as a big fan of Julianne Moore, and thought Ludlow being involved brought some decent acting to the film.The directing and look of the film is fine but the script is basically a B movie rip off with one of the most predictable scripts , that steals many con
plots from other movies, and becomes a dull slow dull con thriller- imagine a bad rip off of Grifters/Catch me if you/Nikita but with so many fake grifter con artists that you start to just laugh at the absurdity of the script.It could have been a good script yet it is always amazing to see a good idea get turned into something that is far from smart or sharp - more like dumb and dumber where there is a million in one chance anyone believes the character and grifts /cons in this story.A few obvious spoilers -
the fake Rolex and cop over paying - rather than just taking the watch and cash. Duh!The waste of time trading Sandy a la femme Nikita or Leon which Luc Bessin wants credit forThe husband leaving everything to Madeline and she easily could just fly away and end of story.Or the worst part is the most trite twist ending of a fake shooting death but then she agrees to not just give the inheritance money back but sign it over to the Foundation - ha haand then they put con artists on a cheap flight /plane to figure out they were conned. Nope - the screen writer conned whomever green lit this terrible projectWas there really any reason to have Sandy on the same flight ? Ha ha It just gets worst and worst by the minuteYou know it's terrible writing when the Final twist con has to be explained at the end - as if it's going to make the horrendous script get validated for such a far fetched piece of predictable garbage. This film is not Ocean 11 or even remotely Sharp.4 stars for Julianne Moore and actors.",4/10
Sharper (2023),"This is a stylish film. It has a very talented cast. The problem is that a con should not feel like a con and have the audience sense it.

And it does here. The finale was poor and unconvincing.""Are you buying this?No... I'm not buying it. It's quite clear what is going on and even the ending doesn't quite add up completely and goes one step too far.

The Intel agencies all over the world would be astonished by such achievement3) the plot twist wasn't a plot twist at all but the writing on the wall4) The millionaires and billionaires do a background check even on their cleaning staff so do you think they have been so incompetent for Madeline to have a chance? Don't you think they would have checked also the billionaire sons girlfriend? This is ridiculous.5) Even if I turn a blind eye to all the things mentioned before, the succession of events makes absolutely no sense. Madeline become the inheritor because the son foolishly lost a huge sum of money so in order for the plot to happen the son should sabotage himself, the father would have had exactly that reaction, Madeline should stupidly take the gun and shoot Tom in the chest ( not head, not in the foot hand or air) and after that she would sign off the rights. How it that making any sense unless you need for the plot to happen.",4/10

The old rich guy would have had his dating pool thoroughly investigated before inviting in the queen bee. In this film we are lead to believe a guy with 9B never did this to discovery that her son really was her boyfriend and accomplice? This is so naive on so many levels.

Enjoyable to watch and you're just hoping for something great towards the end. Sadly what we get here is a clogged sink. It's flowing and flowing and then it starts to clog and by the end what you get is a clogged sink.The water is dirty, there's no flow, everything is rushed and the whole movie is pretty much a failure.

A customer walks in, and we learn she is Sandra, a Ph. D. student at NYU. They hit it off, and Tom asks her out to dinner... At this point we are less than 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the latest from British director Benjamin Caron. Here he brings us a psychological thriller in which a con plays out. The movie is super plot-heavy so I won't say another word about that, but I will make the general comment that it's frankly impossible to fully grasp who is conning whom exactly until the movie's last scene. In other words: you are watching a film where you have no idea what is going on as it is happening. Julianna Moore gets top billing but actually doesn't appear in the movie until about halfway through. John Lithow is her ultra-rich partner. Briana Middleton shines as Sandra. The movie is highly stylish, and at times comes across as neo-noir.""Sharper"" received a very limited 1 week US theatrical release and then started streaming on Apple TV this past weekend.

Sharper (2023),"This was a really well put together film by a director and two co-writers that basically have only created TV movies and series. The real standout for me was the nonlinear narrative storytelling and introduction/background of each character. That way of story-telling is a huge risk and few can succeed filming this way, but these group of filmmakers made it work, and work well. The screenplay was sleek, smart and sophisticated. Each chapter elevates the previous one, and increases the already present scale of suspense and tension. There's enough twists and turns to make your head spin for the rest of the year. The story did have some plot and technical issues, especially in the final act, but everything leading up to the ending still stood out and impressed, especially if you just sit back and enjoy the ride instead of nitpicking minor details. The cinematography was outstanding, as was the score, and all casting and performances were spot-on and convincing. If you're a fan of Succession or Billions, this is right up your alley. A well deserved 9/10 from me.",9/10

It reeked of studio wanting a tacked on happy ending that made no sense at all, with the baddies easily dismissed and everyone happy and safe and the good billionaire getting to keep his dads money after all ahh.....
It just ruined the whole experience and undid the previous 90 mins of story and acting. The cast had done quite well with selling it up till then, but..... urgh, that was a terrible 'twist' too far, and looking back at the rest of the film you could see other tropes and bad writing that we'd been willing to ignore in the hopes of a satisfying journey.No luck with that.",4/10
Sharper (2023),"""Sharper"" is a movie that could have been great, but ultimately ends up being just average.

Sebastian Stan also delivers a solid performance, but his character is underdeveloped and doesn't leave much of an impression.Overall, ""Sharper"" is a movie that has its moments, but doesn't quite come together in a way that is truly memorable.

Sharper (2023),"Sharper is slickly shot for a con-thriller, playing out like a four-part mini-series. But since it's a 2h film, it flounders in its efforts to make us care for the eventual triumph of any of its protagonists. Everyone is grey-shaded and deceitful, and once the point is made early on in the second chapter, I sat back wanting everyone to screw each other over. And for what's worth, the Benjamin Caron directorial offers exactly that!The twists start piling up rather unconvincingly, but the film never fails to engage you due to the presence of charismatic performers such as Julianne Moore and Sebastian Stan. I'd also like to see Briana Middleton and Justice Smith in a straightforward romantic comedy, if someone's willing to make that happen. The climactic twist is easily foreseeable if you've watched other con-thrillers or paid sufficient attention to the proceedings in this one. Folks at A24, you can do better!",5/10
Sharper (2023),"Julianne Moore deserves a script much better than this. It's worth watching just to see her control and elevate every scene she's in. The film thinks it's a lot better than it is, being a very poor knock off of Mamet, and swings way too hard to be successful - missing wildly. Lithgow is also, of course, brilliant and Middleton is someone to watch in future. I really wish they had trimmed this down and focused on developing a real threat, and a deserved payoff. As it is, watching cons always has an appeal, even when poorly scripted like here, and Moore really does bring this from a 1/10 to a 5/10.

It's just a crisp grifter story, and if you liked movies like ""Confidence,"" I suspect you'll like this too.If I had one minor complaint, it's that the con artists here aren't faced with a lot of dangerous resistance through most of the story, easily finding non-threatening marks... it all looks so easy.

Instead of being distracting, the device of telling the story from individual character's perspective and jumping around in time seemed to let the story unfold in a very natural way. Perhaps I'm not as well-versed in con movies as some other reviewers here, but I got so involved in the story that I honestly didn't see the final twist coming, and was very satisfied with how the movie ended.

It's a tired and overplayed formula that is just so predictable. I hate to say this also because the main black actors were both incredible.This film kept me engaged for the first half. There were some despicable yet potential anti-heroes introduced, and the plot could have gone in any direction. It kept the viewer engaged.

Sharper (2023),"'Sharper' is my kind of movie. But there's a reason we don't get many of them these days, which I'll get to shortly. It saddens me but I also completely understand it. Still, this movie was a lot of fun and is the kind of film I'm happy to accept will never be perfect.The problem with the con-artist genre was that the audience became too aware of every move in the playbook. I never call films predictable - and I detest it when people do, because a simple possibility running through your brain at some point in the run time and turning out to be correct does not make something predictable - however this is the kind of film where I can at least forgive that word being thrown around here and there.Which is ironic because these films were basically designed to be the least predictable of all the genres. They were designed to hit you with a dozen twists, each more shocking than the last. But soon audiences caught on that everything was the opposite of what it seemed and suddenly the films weren't as fun any more.So anyway, back to 'Sharper'. We see the film from each character's perspective in different segments. It's a really good format for a film like this. We are always getting new information, but we are also seeing information we thought we already knew from a different and altered point of view. It does a great job of keeping the audience invested and on their toes.The film has good dialogue, a good cast and great pacing. The two hours will fly by even though there is almost nothing in the way of action sequences. For a genre that some might consider DOA, I think 'Sharper' was a pretty good all around effort. 8/10.",8/10
Sharper (2023),"I was actually enjoying this film and expected to recommend it to friends. It held my attention almost until the ending which I found to be flat, leaving me with the feeling there were too many questions left unanswered. It had been going along so well and I didn't begin to question the motives of the characters until I had watched about three quarters of the film. The stylistic decisions were great-I appreciated the visual contrast of the environments of Tom's dusty, dimly lit bookstore and his father's slick and artificial looking, gold detailed apartment.I wanted to know what became of Max and the gold digging stepmother. Wasn't she still trustee of the foundation and if so, wouldn't that leave Tom at further risk? I was disappointed that Tom left the bookstore with Sandra/Sandy at the end. If she had somehow been connected to Tom's plan to recoup his stolen inheritance the outcome would have felt more positive. I'm glad I watched it. The performances were believable and quite good, but I was pleased with the film's conclusion,",6/10
Sharper (2023),"A ""sharper,"" as told in the opening credits of the A24 and Apple collaboration aptly titled Sharper, is ""someone who lives by their wits."" For the most part, everyone in Sharper keeps their wits about them. That could be what makes the film feel both like a surprisingly assured debut and as if something is missing. With a stunning cast, Sharper is everything that it needs to be - a sleek, neo-noir riff on grifters and scammers that is twisty and fun. But, just when things really ramp up, Sharper skimps on the chaos and settles for a neat ending that leaves something to be desired. Sharper begins with a simple love story between Tom (Justice Smith) and Sandra (Briana Middleton). Sandra wanders into Tom's bookstore, mentions Jane Eyre, and the two quickly fall into each other's arms. There's just one problem: Sandra's brother owes some guys $350,000. Conveniently, Tom has that (and more) in his bank account. Here, anyone who would consider themselves a ""sharper"" should begin to piece together that Sandra may not be who she says she is. The film wastes no time in confirming those suspicions, revealing its kaleidoscopic tale of cons and grifters in the upper echelon of New York society. After Sandra's con on Tom, Sharper quickly reveals the structure in which it is going to tell its story, a deceptive, albeit believable move through time and perspective. This kind of deceptive storytelling was a hotly debated topic after the release of Glass Onion and that movie's reveal of its own twist that relied on going back in time. For all its shortcomings, Sharper manages to pull together all of its cons with a finesse that could have easily been bungled in less capable hands. Even if it fails at its greatest con of all - pulling one over on audiences - it still manages to be a taut thriller that feels fully realized. Hollywood has long lamented the death of the mid-budget, original adult movie, but Sharper certainly fits that bill. That Apple is a place that is willing to produce these should come as no surprise. Instead of having an established catalog, the streamer is slowly building out one filled with its own original content. Sharper is at least a worthy addition to that library. The psychological thriller ""Sharper"" begins with an on-screen definition of its title word: ""One who lives by their wits."" While you may find yourself wishing this movie, directed by Benjamin Caron (whose credits include multiple episodes of ""The Crown""), was just a bit sharper, it's an engrossing-enough tale of con artists; of people putting on a performance in order to gain something. You can see why the cast would be drawn to this story: Nearly every character in ""Sharper"" is an actor, of the uncredited sort; almost nobody is exactly what they seem.",10/10
Sharper (2023),"Well acted, shot and produced, has some nice twists, and the central idea isn't bad.. But it could've been better to me. They started it like a classic romcom and they shouldn't. Why would you make it similar to the dying, almost certain box-office bomb these days? Just to make it different? Just to have that twist? Make it interesting and engaging throughout the whole movie. Read the room. 60 minutes in and you don't know who to root for because none of the characters has any background, they are not caricatures but they have barely any motivation. And it doesn't end much better. Flat and unengaging.",5/10
Sharper (2023),"Tom owns a bookshop bought by dad, their relationship is best described as sad, expectations of each other, after losing wife and mother, would be distant, disconnected, going bad. Then Sandy makes a play to win Tom's heart, she's attractive, most engaging and loves art, but she has some brother woes, and two sharks, who will foreclose, and she's hoping Tom can stop them, help outsmart. Max is disaffected and rejected, his partner has gone off, so unexpected, so he helps society, enabling, sobriety, and therefore Sandra learns of things, that she's neglected. Madeline took her chance while it was there, to marry Richard, who's a wealthy billionaire, now she's a step mom, and a wife, although it causes her some strife, but she'll get over it, although there'll be despair.",6/10
Sharper (2023),"When you have that kind of budget, why can't you pay a good writer to come up with a somewhat original story?! I only watched the first 30 min or so and the whole thing started cracking up. First, the trick with the watch and the parole officer - copied from Catch Me If You Can. Then the whole thing with the training, I had a feeling I was watching a Luc Beson movie, maybe Nikita or Leon: The Professional. There's that saying: ""There's nothing new except what has been forgotten."" I mean, probably, every artist ""borrows"" from other artists to some extent. But when it's so obvious, the best word that comes to mind is ""fake"". In this case, even the good cinematography couldn't help. I feel like I wasted my time.",2/10
Sharper (2023),"Julianna Moore is an amazing actor. John Lithgow has been recognized (and rightfully so) for his comedic talents and I think underrated for his dramatic talents. It makes me ask the question- why are you two here in this film? Lithgow does nothing here. Moore is great but that's like saying the pie was delicious, it's too bad the dish it was served on was made out of crap. The film is predictable, unoriginal and boring. Non linear storytelling can be hard to execute and this film highlights that fact. It also seems to congratulate it self for being soooo smart. It IS NOT smart. These supposedly insanely smart con artists duped by a fake shooting? No body can tell a corpse is still breathing? The genius doesn't try to get the blood of her clothes until she's on the plane. Wow. Watch ""The Maltese Falcon"" for smart... or The Sixth Sense for a true surprise ending. Other than Moore, there's nothing to see here.",1/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"""The Banshees of Inisherin"" is an idiosyncratic blend of funny, sad, and more than anything lonely, acted by one of the best casts of the year.Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson are two friends who have a falling out because one simply doesn't want to be friends with the other anymore. Why? Because he's become aware of how quickly his life is slipping by and he doesn't want to waste it on dull people. The other takes offense, obviously, and starts out trying to win the other back until his friend's obstinance causes his simmering animosity to boil over.At first I was relating to Gleeson's character because I've felt like him. Life is too short to spend on relationships that don't add value. But as his behavior gets more and more extreme and.....well....let's just say out of hand (wink, wink), we start to realize how unwell he is and sympathies shift to Farrell's character. Until we start to realize how selfish he actually is and how much his own actions are driven more by wanting to be liked than by concern for his friend. And that's one of the things I liked most about the movie. These are characters dealing with the existentialism inherent in being a human being living on the planet, warts and all, and we see ourselves in all of it, both the good and the bad. Though set in the 1920s, this very much felt like a film inspired by the isolation and loneliness brought about by a global pandemic.The standout of the cast is Kerry Condon as Farrell's sister. She's an antidote to the male angst pervading this little Irish village. While the men are content to stew and whine and complain about dull pointless lives that they don't do anything to change, she gets fed up with how boring they all are and decides to grab her own bit of happiness. Also good is Barry Keoghan as perhaps the film's most heartbreaking character.And lest everything I've written above makes this film sound dour and depressing, did I also mention that it's very very funny? Funny in a Martin McDonagh way, to be sure, but it'll have you chuckling if you get his particular vibe.Grade: A.",8/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"You've played together, endured the weather, for many years; but something's changed, you've been estranged, gears now sheared; the reason seems completely mad, you've not done anything that's bad, the situation's quite bizarre and very weird. So you persevere, keep holding out your hand, but all that does, is cause the flames, to be more fanned, out of spite your friend wont linger, raises more than a mid-finger, it's like you've been black balled, suppressed, banished and banned. More diplomacy results in loss and pain, while there's nothing to be won, you won't refrain, the lines have now been drawn, only one thing this will spawn, it's as avoidable, as it's stupid and insane.Reflecting the friction and war taking place over the water, and the reasons for it, with four outstanding performances, although Barry Keoghan absolutely knocks it out of the park, a film to get you thinking about what it means to get along, and the repercussions when two tribes don't, even over the most trivial of torments.",8/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"I think, perhaps, you have to be in a certain mood to watch and appreciate this film properly. Patient, but alert and attentive to catch the subtleties of the slow-burn plot.Oh...I should mention it is very Irish. If you don't know what that means, well... watch the film and you'll get a glimmer.The acting and scenery are marvelous, as others have noted. The plot as a metaphor for the Irish Civil War and so on.The strange sudden ""unfriending"" and the bizarre twists and turns it takes as a commentary on human nature and isolation amid a tedious present and an uncertain future.There's no hand-holding and you have to read between the lines to understand it well. The humor is dry, dark and subtle, sprinkled in by small doses.I suppose I must have been in the right mood to appreciate it, and largely absent expectations (other than that there would be good acting, which was so).People expecting more of a comedy will be disappointed, I think, as will those expecting a light-hearted or uplifting conclusion.Still, I thought it was quite interesting, and certainly different.",7/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"It is 1923 and the Irish civil war has not reached the small island of Inisherin. 40-something Padraic lives with his sister, eking out an agricultural living, and spending what appears to be quite a lot of spare time at the pub with his best friend for years, olderman and fiddle player Colm. Then, one day, Colm tells him that he doesn't want to be friends any more, without providing any sort of reason (he does later). Padraic is devastated and confused and persists in bothering Colm for understanding in the face of Colm's blunt statement that we wants Padraic to leave him alone.I loved Martin McDonough's In Bruges and Three Billboards (Seven Psychopaths had its moments), and Colin Farell and Brendan Gleeson easily find their In Bruges chemistry again. The cinematography, sets and locations, are bleak and beautiful, the acting from all the cast is great, and the script, often funny, thoughtfully ruminates on friendship, loneliness, isolation, mortality, stubbornness, and various other related concepts.Yes I was disappointed. Why? The synopsis above comes from the trailer, and although the story of these two once-friends does progress further, there are two things it never does.One, it never explains Colm's decision. Colm gives his reasons but, frankly, they are irrational, as are his subsequent actions. I can understand Padraic'ss frustratiin, because I shared it. None of it made sense unless an external agency was at work - depression, dementia, psychosis, witchcraft...Two, it never resolves. The two obvious resolutions would have been reconciliation or tragedy, but the film never gets as far as either, which left me dissatisfied.This film, to me, broke its promises.",7/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"It is a well told dark comedy that keeps you wanting more, in a time when Ireland was full of despair, not long after the war of Independence and a long-suffering period that brought about a post-colonial inferiority complex (still hasn't been addressed to this day), a struggle for an identity, a repressive church, superstitions, isolation, mass emigration, poverty and to top it all off a brutal civil war. This film does a great job to put you in the psych of the time and to top that off the cinematography, costumes, music and atmosphere are wonderful. The film is itself a bit of a conundrum, on one hand it leaves you thinking nonstop about the story and the premise, while on the other hand you feel cheated by its abruptness.Pádraic ó Súilleabháin (Colin Farrell) is just a nice man who struggles to deal with losing his friendship with Colm Doherty (Brendan Gleeson) and the further loss he endures. Colm, himself is in a fight against time and his age. The dark struggle of helplessness or despair is rife on the Island, but the story telling is done so well it comes across uplifting at times with light-hearted comedy sprinkled on top. Siobhán ní Súilleabháin (Kerry Condon) is a rock to Pádraic, but she is herself tied to the antics of the Island and Dominic Kearney (Barry Keoghan) must suffer with his own demons while he searches for love.Both leads Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson knock it out of the park, but the two shining stars for me were Barry Keoghan and the beautiful Kerry Condon. I thought the film was going to take a turn for the D'Unbelievables at one point when Pat Shortt who plays Jonjo Devine and Jon Kenny who plays Gerry pop up on the screen, but after a brief scare they turned out to be a good addition to the banter and gossip in the pub scenes.It's not perfect and lets you down in a few areas. Some of the dialogue feels out of place especially for the part of Ireland and the time period, which was a shame, as it transports you out of the screen and back into the cinema (this seems to be a modern trend with period film). The setting was also a bit too squeaky clean; brand new clean clothes, polished teeth, shoes galore, fresh faces (apart from Colin Farrell who did look like he spent years working in the elements) the poverty of the time could have been showcased a bit more.My wife and I both enjoyed this film immensely. Any fan of dark comedy, this film is a must see with a word of warning: I would be aware if you are going to see this movie and you are emotionally fragile, that it does tap into the dark side of your brain and leaves you in deep thought when it is finished.8/10.",8/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"5 years after his brilliant dark comedy ""Three Billboards, Outside Ebbing, Missouri"", Martin Mcdonagh directs another brilliant tale about Friendship, Ambition and Loneliness. The Banshees of Inisherin is the best a Mcdonagh movie has ever looked, every scene has a visual landscape setting and color tone is completely balanced.The movie revolves around 3 arcs and all the 3 have their perfect conclusions and intersect cleverly. It's one of the best writing you will ever see. Like 3 Billboards there is a perfect blend of humour and tragedy. The stories revolve around Colin Farrell coming to terms that his best friend doesn't want to do anything with him, his sister played by Kerry Cordon trying to find the ultimate purpose in her life and Dominic played by Barry Keoghan, who is living a worst life possible.Colin Farrell has been doing some great work over the last 20 years and this is his Eureka, Eureka moment. The Banshees of Inisherin is the best movie of the year so far and deserves both commercial and critical acclaim. Very rarely movies that satisfy everyone are made, this is one of them.",10/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"It's hard to tell if this is a wonderful dark comedy or a a Shakespearean tragedy. Served by a magistral group of actors and actress, ""Banshees"" takes you to stunning Irish landscapes and numbs you with its comfortable scenery, cute farm animals and lovely violin tunes in the good old pub... Until men display a classic story of pride and stubbornness.Like a dark children tale, the movie seems to be a metaphor of the stupidity of war and humanity's contradictions. Collin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson and a scene stealing Barry Keoghan are just wonderful at creating those flawed and unique men spiraling into their destiny. While Kerry Condon as the reasonable woman represents perfectly the fatality of this world.Martin McDonagh created a fantastic piece of filmmaking, a sadly very timely message that I would love to see adapted as a play.",10/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"As ""The Banchees of Inisherin"" (2022 release from Ireland; 114 min) opens, the Colin Farrell character, a guy named Padriac, stops by the Breandon Gleeson character, a guy named Colm who is Padriac's best friend. That is, until that moment. For reasons unknown, Colm wants nothing more to do with Padriac. ""I just don't like you anymore"" Colm offers. The calendar shows ""April 1, 1923"", and Padriac doesn't take this unexplained change of behavior by Colm very well... At this point we are 10 min into the movie.Couple of comments: this is the highly anticipated reunion of writer-director Martin McDonagh, and lead performers Farrell and Gleeson, 14 years after the now classic ""In Bruges"". I too was eager to see how this reunion would play out, but then something completely unexpected happened: I found the Colin Farrell character to be irritating and off-putting, to the point where it was almost too much to bear or see. Without spoiling anything, I will say that things are somewhat better in the movie's second hour. But I could never get into the proper flow of the movie, let alone rave about it as many others have done. I completely understand that my viewpoint is definitely in the minority. And that this film has been hailed critically (it's currently rated 97% Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes). The most striking thing about the movie for me was the strong performance of Barry Keoghan (who starred in ""Dunkirk"" a few years back). This is a subjective opinion of course.""The Banchees of Inisherin"" premiered at this year's Venice Film Festival to universal acclaim, and opened in theaters a few weeks ago. The Sunday early evening screening where I saw this at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended okay (I counted about 15 people). If you are a fan of Martin McDonagh's earlier work of or Colin Farrell or Brendon Gleeson, I'd readily suggest you check this out, and draw your own conclusion.",6/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"Martin McDonagh has made an extraordinary film in so many ways, starting with the brilliant theatrical script and the performances of all the main actors involved: Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson, Barry Keoghan, and Kerry Condon. This also applies to all the supporting roles.The humour is brilliant, the film is extremely funny but also meaningful and difficult to interpret, at times shocking and quite unpredictable. It is hard not to empathise with the characters and their vicissitudes. At the end of the screening, more then receiving answers, I felt I had learnt and witnessed something important, even though I couldn't immediately point what. A beautiful film that triggers deep reflection.",10/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"I sat down prepared for an outstanding movie, what I got was nothing close to what I was expecting.As my title states, the actors could not be faulted in any way, as I found them to be superb, having me hooked with their interactions. Colin Farrell with the most screen time simply shines, having me wish he were more prolific in projects. Brendan Gleeson also does a stellar job, as does Kerry Condon. Even the other minor characters were well written and very well acted by their respective actors. I can't think of a single actor who did a poor job, heck even the animals did a good job. Excellent cinematography as well.However, while the dialogue was extremely well written, the script itself was somewhat lacking. I kept waiting for the payoff during the movie that simply never came, making me wonder what I just watched.Go in for the acting and you will not be disappointed, however the overall story might let you down.",6/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"I gave it five stars: one each for the main actors and one for the location. It was marvelously acted. Brendan Gleeson, Kerry Condon and Colin Farrell were all outstanding, but I thought Barry Keoghan delivered the best performance.That said, other than the stunning scenery, it was deadly dull and dreary. Stupid really. An inexplicable turn on a friendship; never explained; and never resolved.It seemed more like a play to me than a film. A bunch of disconnected plot strands that leave you wondering why this film has received the good reviews it has received. Was it worth watching? The answer to that is as unresolved as the plot.",5/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"What starts as an original and funny approach to themes of friendship, loss and self growth slowly takes a dark turn to an unnecessary sequence of macabre events that ultimately end in a not so much satisfactory manner.I have no issues with odd or unorthodox approaches to movie making but I do not personally enjoy when things take violent approaches specially when involving animals (regardless of course of the fact that no animals were really harmed) just for the sake of it... the movie as I mentioned starts with an interesting plot when one man simply decides to stop talking to his long term best friend without any concrete apparent reason for it.The environment, the locations and of course the acting makes the movie and got me interested through half of it, then when the previously mentioned dark events start to happen it becomes strange and it slowly becomes less interesting.I read some of the critics and interpretations of the film and aside from its themes of friendship, depression, human nature it also serves as an apparent metaphor to the real life Irish civil war, similarly to the previous Oscar season where we also had another film debating the same topic.I get the symbolisms but again for me personally they didn't come through to me with this weird darkish comedy approach, I don't feel it's worth of Oscar recognition while I do praise the acting as well as the great atmosphere captured in rural Ireland.",6/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"Are those who live on islands human beings like everyone else? This film clearly tells us no: the island, an enclosed place where everything is concentrated and which the surrounding sea keeps compressed, deeply affects its inhabitants and permeates them with itself, sickens them with its own disease. The latest film by Englishman Martin McDonagh (in his 4th feature film, with 3 films behind him, all of which are top-notch) is absolutely superb: for storytelling ability, for location (evocative, rocky Irish island), for the brilliance of the screenplay (let's face it: McDonagh writes really well!), for acting (impressive Colin Farrell and Brendan Gleeson, also excellent Barry Keoghan and Kerry Condon). The story is told of Padraic (Farrell), good and kind, who, overnight, loses the consideration of his greatest friend, Colm (Gleeson). Why? Because I don't like you anymore, because you're boring, Colm replies to him, and I don't want to waste my time with you anymore. And Padraic, who is not as sharp and intelligent as he would like to be but is esteemed for his courtesy and good spirits, does not understand this. Colm, who plays the violin and composes music, is obsessed with the passing of time, with the need to indulge his art in order not to be forgotten. His art demands total exclusivity from him, leaving no room for the banality of feelings. But is this the real reason, or is Colm going mad? At this point, what follows is a jeu de massacre between the two ex-friends, surrounded by various minor characters that McDonagh knows how to connote with felicitous psychological notations and a keen sense of humor. And then there are the animals, almost sacred emanations of the island, loved and respected, more than human in their affective reactions. And there is the war, distant but present, of which ominous explosions are heard in the distance. And finally there is the old witch, a representation of Death that rivals even the Bengt Ekerot of ""The Seventh Seal."" In short, a beautiful and poignant film like few we see. Not to be missed!",9/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"The Banshees of Inisherin was an unusual movie, featuring gorgeous vistas, on-point acting and haunting music. However, it was ultimately unsatisfying because it never really rose above a persistent, downbeat nihilism.I took the movie as a kind of allegory on human irrationality and miscommunication, seen vividly on the mainland during the Irish Civil War, and in microcosm in the relationship between Padraic and Colm.It was also an extended study on the wages of untreated mental illness, as Colm chose to do nothing to treat his ""despair"" (that is, depression), and instead wreaked havoc upon himself and his erstwhile best mate.My problem with Banshees is that the great movies that reflect the insanity of the human condition, at the end of the day, still have something redemptive about them. The great anti-war, movies-Bridge on the River Kwai, For Whom the Bell Tolls, MASH, Atonement-all deliver some form of redemption amid the pain. Banshees only leaves one feeling hopeless at the end. The very bleakness of the movie unfortunately drags it down.",6/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"I was enthralled by the beginning of this film, which to me had all the makings of a symphonic, filmatic masterpiece. Shot on the beautious islands of Inishmore and Achill on the West Coast of Ireland, the scenery and cinematography are second to none. The actors deliver award winning performances. And my god, how I adore the Irish dialect and music, the little donkey, heart tugging turn of relationship, and the few funny lines scattered throughout as well. ""Wow"" I thought, This is fantastic! There should be more films like this,"" but halfway through, my reaction shifted.Pádraic, (Colin Farrell), the nicest of men, who lives with his intelligent but island-locked sister Siobhán, (Kerry Condon), has his heart broken when his longtime friend Colm, (Brendan Gleeson), in a demented existential crisis, calls him a dullard and manipulatively shuts him out of his life with absolutely no warning on this island where everyone knows everyone's business and there is no way to avoid someone. We also get to know the town's sadistic policeman who abuses his son Dominic, known as the town fool, a genial bartender, gossipy shopkeeper, and old female ghoul who shadows Pádraic warning him of impending deaths on the island.The escalation of bizarre and tragic negative events and actions did nothing positive for me. I had looked forward to this movie thinking it was an art house film and comedy. Halfway in, when one of the character's starts cutting off his body parts, I realized I had been seduced by misleading PR. To me, this is a gory horror film that left me nauseous and depressed. I regret watching it.",4/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),Super locations. Great photography. Masterful Production design. The acting is world class. So why didn't I enjoy this film? Because it promises to say something and goes nowhere. I'm obviously in the minority here but I wish my expectations hadn't been raised so high. It's dark but a slow almost empty darkness. I'll forget this film very quickly. Which is a good thing for me but doesn't say much for the quality of the story. It feels like there was much more there somewhere but it didn't make it out. Perhaps watching it on a rainy Monday evening didn't help. Also please don't go thinking this is a comedy or anything at all like 'In Bruges'. It's very far from funny. It's very far from the quality of that film.,6/10

Banshees of Inisherin was pointless, uninteresting and a waste of time, if you like it, I'm happy for you. If you see the trailer and think that looks good, it will be, the trailer is very tonally accurate. I kept telling myself ""get on with it"" and it just ends. No resolution, sort of a Greek tragedy but here, unlike most Greek Tragedies there is nothing worth walking away with.

The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"1923 - Colin Farrell lives within a small isolated community on an isle off mainland Ireland where his life largely revolves around pub visits with his friend, Brendan Gleeson. One day, Gleeson tells Farrell he doesn't like him anymore and doesn't want to speak to him because he has nothing of interest to say. The consequences affect them both.An intriguing and occasionally ambiguous take on love and friendship in a strange stand alone world where priorities that drive people are often quite different from what most people are used to. It is also nicely balanced with a sharp, often quite dark sense of humour and features a wide array of lively, eccentric support characters. Key here though and keeping things altogether are the leads who are universally good ie Gleeson, Kerry Condon as Farrell's sister, Barry Keoghan as the local idiot keen to fall in love. Best of all though is Farrell giving one of his finest ever performance which should get him a few award nominations.",6/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"This film collectively is too long/slow and lacking in enough intrigue or comedy to keep me entertained. I did enjoy a few moments and ideas presented in the movie. The setting was enjoyable. The pets were entertaining. A few of the characters and small moments in the story were amusing the way they were presented. The actors did a nice job. The scenery and filming were fine. I don't know if some main point of the movie was to be meta by providing the same kind of blandness in the movie that one character feels in another character to justify the event which is the foundation for the movie. If that was the point, it was awful. If that wasn't the point it was still awful. I think it might have also tried to be deep by having a civil war between two characters to reflect Irelands civil war. If so, I still wasn't impressed. I'm guessing that critics over-inflated the review score of this movie because it's different and tries unusual things. I'm all for innovation if/when it works. But in this case I didn't get any deep emotional or intellectual payoff. Overall it felt frustrating more than anything else.",4/10

In Bruges was superb and I watched again in advance of going to see this.

The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"So, having only seen a few previews for this & only reading briefly what the story was about, I walked into this one a bit blind & not knowing quite what to expect. I was expecting something more upbeat, but walked out thinking ""eh?""The story sees 2 lifelong friends' friendship abruptly ending with 1 of them suddenly not liking the other. However, as the days start to pass do the temperaments of the 2 with alarming consequences for both of them.I found the film to be weird. I mean, I was left sitting there after the credits started to roll wondering what to make of the film. Even now, I find myself trying to decide whether it was bad or good. I'd have to neither, it was ok. The story is simple at least, but the execution of it is quite another ordeal for this film. The execution was bad.I found myself after the first 15-20 minutes I was wondering where the film was going & what the conclusion was going to be because, as I said, I looked up the synopsis prior to watching & sort of got the gist of what to expect. But even the synopsis didn't exactly help as it felt out there. In fact, I couldn't even remember the name of the film, never mind the synopsis without looking the film up. It doesn't help the intrigue if you know what I mean...The humour of course, was dark & the dialogue along with the humour wasn't bad. But, the film felt depressing & seemed to drag on & on with little for me to go. I mean, you got the story, but the above question of where the film was going kept niggling away at me. It was getting repetitive to the point of annoyance & then when it ends, you're left thinking ok, so what was the end goal of the film. It was a bit of a pain to finish, yet somehow, you kept watching to see what would happen as you were lead on by curiosity as to when & how it would end.The film is too out there & again is one of those films which gets critical acclaim for being different basically. The ending explains nothing & for such a simple yet annoying story, which, for the middle part/bulk of the film, offered nothing as to why 1 guy stopped being friends with the other, (aside from him being too dull...), as the film was 1 hour & 48 minutes too long & got nowhere. There could've been more to the film in the middle, but no, they added depressing scenes & annoying bad characters in between just to beef the film up for no reason.Anyway the film is too long, the pacing is dreadful & the story is annoying yet simple. The ending is out there as much as the title & synopsis. Seriously, & they say this film is the best of the writer & director? Wow...Overall, it's a bland, overly long film with a simple, yet annoying story. There's humour, some beautiful tranquil scenery, but aside from that it's a weird film & not one you'd watch with your friends or family unless you like these sort of films.3/10.",3/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"Writer-director Martin McDonagh's dark comedy-drama is one of those films that leaves me (and probably many other viewers) scratching my head, making me sincerely wonder what all the fuss is about. In this fable-like Irish folk tale about two longtime friends (Colin Farrell, Brendan Gleeson) whose relationship suddenly reaches an impasse, they struggle to come to terms of where things go from there in the aftermath of this scenario. There's just one problem here: the picture's razor-thin premise with its virtually nonexistent back story doesn't provide enough basis for why the dissolution of this friendship occurs and then escalates to a tale of inexplicable desperation and truly bewildering retributive self-abuse. Indeed, we seem to know more about the setting of the story - a small island off the western Irish seacoast during the waning days of the new republic's 1922-23 civil war - than we do about its characters, their relationship and their motivations. To compound matters, the narrative stretches out far too long, taking a seeming eternity to unfold with no particularly satisfying payoff, punctuated by lame attempts at humor that mostly fail to land. To its credit, this offering features fine performances by its two principals, as well as superb portrayals by Kerry Condon and Barry Keoghan in supporting roles, all of whom have garnered Golden Globe Award nominations in the acting categories. There's also much to be said for its gorgeous cinematography and atmospheric Carter Burwell original score. However, it's truly mind-boggling to understand how this film has earned eight total Globe nods and four National Board of Review awards, among numerous other inflated and questionable accolades. This tediously dull, slow-paced effort falls woefully short of the fine work the filmmaker achieved in previous films like ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"" (2017) and ""In Bruges"" (2008) (not to mention its lack of the snappy on-screen chemistry that Farrell and Gleeson achieved in that off-beat comedy), accomplishments that make this release come across as a great disappointment by comparison. In fact, at the risk of overstatement, ""Banshees"" could have been edited down to a short, and it still likely would have been a letdown. Catch this one at your peril; at the very least, it's now available for online streaming, so you shouldn't have to venture out if you really want to watch it.",3/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"I wanted to like this movie. Amazing acting and stunning cinematography immerses you in the story and setting. The problem for me is the story itself.We have an island, which means everything is concentrated regarding events and character interactions. This is normally a device that causes tension but here it seems dumb. The two main characters keep running into each other both by chance and intentionally, especially because there seems to only be one pub that neither of them want to stop going to on a daily basis.If that was a set up for a dark comedy, it would make sense but don't fool yourself. While there are a few moments early in that might make you chuckle, THIS IS NOT A COMEDY!Something funny with a resolution is what I was expecting. By the end I felt terrible and angry which was quite a deviation from the film I thought I would be watching. So be careful what you're expecting.If it's a well acted, beautifully set, confusing statement about human relationships with no real resolution then watch with pleasure. If you're looking for a differently set, dark comedy, this is not it.",5/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"Really wanted to like this but although it starts off strong, it seems to lose the plot quite quickly. The acting is very good, the scenery gorgeous, but there's little substance to the story. More could have been done to develop the characters and give the story more of a payoff at the end. Leaves viewers a bit unfulfilled! What exactly is the point of the movie? The comedy is dark, but is there a story in there somewhere? I was expecting a lot more, but this is a very forgettable film! It appears to be more of a comedy and less of a drama. As others have said, it's overhyped and misses its mark!",4/10
The Banshees of Inisherin (2022),"Two is a rather arbitrary rating, scenery was very pleasant and the acting was good all round. Other than that, what a miserable mess this was! I've eagerly waited months to see Banshees of Inisherin and then couldn't believe my eyes at the cruelty, misery, despair and general awfulness of the film. And it's labelled ""comedy""? The most uncomedic film I've seen in many a year!Any funny lines were already revealed in the trailer, so when I finally saw the film I was well familiar with anything humorous in it. Every charming moment was spoiled by the trailer. So the trailer was, in the end, more entertaining than the actual film.Two mentally ill men, apparently long-time friends, spend most of the film going out of their way to make each other's lives miserable. As if they weren't miserable enough already, living small, restricted lives in what is, undeniably, a gorgeous location. Why one, a fiddle player of all things, decides to dismember himself in ""retaliation"" for his one-time friend ""bothering"" him, is beyond me. Clearly the man is mentally ill and needs serious help, but I don't care to sit around and witness them both going to hell in a handbasket.Maybe it's all meant to be allegorical and has some deeply profound meaning that's gone over my head. To me it's two hours of despair, nastiness, bloodshed, stupidity, and a total waste of time. What a dreadful disappointment!",2/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"Blood and Honey is not a good movie. It's poorly written, there are some directorial shots that would never make a movie made by a studio, and there is some pretty cringe acting as well. The characters are paper-thin to the point I can't remember any names. The pacing is a bit off and the effects at times were notably bad.But what did you expect on a budget under $100,000 made by amateurs? I don't feel like my time was wasted by people who used an IP as a lazy money grab. I thought the team tried and did what they could within their means.There were a handful of cool directorial shots, a few fun kills, and some bad in an entertaining way scenes that made this at least watchable. It's a really short film that isn't an absolute chore to get through. This isn't even the worst horror film I've seen this year.If the next time around there is a bigger budget, better writing/editing, and better casting it could be fine. A lot of their issues seemed to be budget or inexperience related as opposed to offensively bad or incompetent.",4/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"First of all, the movie is really bad but its badness has made it entertaining in certain aspects. The main reason for the badness of the film is the acting. It may be the worst cast I've ever seen in my life. They act so badly in every scene that it's unbelievable. The acting is a disaster and it really ruined the movie.There were 3-4 bloody scenes in the movie that looked good in the cinema, but some scenes were incredibly unnecessary and long. Also, the nudity was forced on us before the characters died. It would have been better if they had chosen the cast according to the movie's requirements.Actually, when I first heard about the movie, I thought it might be interesting. It has a low budget and a different structure. However, the screenplay that the director chose was extremely bad, which ruined the movie. Although I really liked the animation in the first part, the costumes of Piglet and Winnie were incredibly artificial and awful, which turned the horror scenes into comedy.It would have been better if it had been written much better and if it had been adapted to the screen with good costumes in a short time. Unfortunately, our director has made very bad choices and has created a disaster of a movie. He has disrespected the characters' past. There's really nothing worth watching in this movie.2.",2/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"The concept is the only decent thing about the film. The acting, visuals, dialogue & execution is just horrid. Many moments where common sense & logic just goes out the window. Some of the problems to list: #1 most of the characters are just bland; only the slutty/preppy one has any sort of character to herself. #2 The Christopher character is just annoying with half his dialogue being an hysterical ""why you doing this"". #3 One of the female group characters discovered their friends corpse outside notices the windows covered in blood saying something and she states ""it has to be the same people""... no its the pizza delivery guy (sarcasm).... I don't think anyone is THAT stupid to put 2 & 2 together to need to have that verbally stated... perfect example of horrid writing. #4 2 of the girls unties another woman they discover who digs out a gun to go after ""Piglet"" ends up shooting off a shot to get his attention then tries to shoot again just to run out of ammo, right after that happens ""Winnie"" is behind her for the kill..... The 2 girls are watching this all go down yet never warn her?!?!",2/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"I fully expected Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey to have indistinguishable disposable characters, kills that are gross and mean-spirited, a bone-thin plot, inane dialogue, and acting that is...mediocre at best.I was right about the film having all of these things, and I didn't mind these things. They're par-for-the-course in the slasher genre, and I embrace the self-aware trashiness of it all.What I was not prepared for was just how boring this movie is. And it's because it does not even attempt to make use of its characters that should make for a slam-dunk of a hilariously enjoyable concept.Christopher Robin and his college friends should have been the focal characters. But Christopher Robin is barely in this movie and instead we get a group of vapid girls who have no relation to Christopher. They get killed off instead, and there is no reason to care because they're completely detached from the connection between Pooh and Christopher at the beginning of the film.It would have been so easy for them to capitalise on a concept that could only be found in Winnie-the-Pooh: the animals kill Christopher's family and friends as revenge for him abandoning them. But the plot we got could be interchanged with literally any other plot in the slasher genre, as it's just a bunch of randos getting killed.What also doesn't help this disaster is the awful editing. Almost every shot lasts longer than it should, and it makes each scene feel agonisingly long.It's a film where we watch a lot of half-baked ideas play out on screen, and none of them are unique. None of them are what I wanted to see from a concept as silly as this.This could have been hilariously good fun. Instead, it's identical to the rest of the trash you can find in bottom-of-the-barrel horror.",2/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"This movie is not a finished product, not even close. This needed AT LEAST a month or two longer in the editing room because it is a mess! I'm not even talking about the terrible story or acting because I knew I was getting that regardless, which is no problem for me as long as there's some carnage. I'm talking about the atrocious sound mixing/editing, the abrupt cuts and transitions, and nauseating camera work. The basics of filmmaking! Whenever someone is getting murdered, you can't even tell what is going on because the camera work is so amateurish and shoddy. It's almost like the camera operator was having a seizure whenever they were supposed to film a kill.This movie had a $100,000 budget, yet they showed almost no gore/make-up FX when someone would die. If you're filming a low-budget B horror movie, people are going for the kills and not much else, therefore you better be pumping 80% of your budget into the ""horror"" aspect of the movie and show some people getting slaughtered.Terrifier 1 had a $25,000 (a fraction of Blood and Honey's budget), yet showed every kill in grisly detail and people LOVED it! Then they made a sequel for $250,000 and made 13 million off it. I'm not sure where the $100,000 budget of this movie went, but it was most definitely not the kills, editing or acting. Maybe Pooh and Piglet's costumes were each $50,000 a piece, and if so the costume designer definitely pocketed that money.The only reason I'm not giving this a 1 is because I like the concept of taking a fictional character from the public domain and putting a B horror twist on it. Though a good concept, the execution could not have been much worse. This should not have left editing room let alone released IN THEATERS! The distribution company should be held accountable. It's like video game developers releasing unfinished games. Trash.2/10.",2/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"I like films and movies in general and horror is one of my favorite genres. Lately I've been getting into the more low budget films where the filmmakers rely on creativity over showing off the budget on special effects and past their prime actors looking to still be in movies. A lot of the ones I've seen in fact have fallen into the ""so bad it's good"" or cheesy and over the top category that you can't help but have fun because everyone involved with the film clearly was while making it!Unfortunately this is a train wreck that absolutely needed more time to be polished. The worst part about this is that you can see that there some solid foundations in some of the way the shots were setup & the premise is a decent one to build from. The problem is that this looks like it was executed by someone who is learning to make movies, which is fine, but it probably should've gotten more time in front of other filmmakers that could've pointed out the obvious flaws.One big flaw that this movie has is that the narrative is difficult to follow. Scenes that should establish who the characters and help the audience follow what is happening with them as the story progresses is non-existent. Characters literally pop in & out of thin air and things happen to them but you don't see how the story takes them from point a to b. In additions to this, the movie is impossibly dark to the point where you literally can't see anything except random things meant to represent the characters and objects they're holding or moving around! Several scenes were just so dark that you couldn't tell where the characters are in relation each other or the scenery. Movies are a visual medium, you need to see what is happening or at least have an inkling of what is unfolding even if you're not supposed to see things clearly!The plot about Winnie-the-Pooh and the other forest animals turning feral after Christopher Robin left them to be an adult was a good starting point but ultimately went nowhere. Why did Pooh & Piglet wind up torturing or killing people if they became ravenous from hunger instead of eating them? Why is Christopher Robin just barely in the movie, while the focus is on a bunch of other characters that we literally know nothing about?Clearly you can see the inexperience of the director on display here as some scenes and shots are well done while others are absolute trash. I'm sure given enough time they will improve with more movies under their belt but they need someone to help guide & mentor them so that they can make a movie that is watchable. Sure, this was a micro budget effort but it's advertised like it has more money behind it than it really does. If this guy had a solid fundamentals I'd be complaining more about the story than how everything is presented! And the presentation doesn't require fancy cameras or special effects, you just need good clear shots and narrative flow which don't require a ton of money if given the time to do it right!Lastly, I heard that there is already a sequel in the works? How in the hell did this piece of garbage manage to get a sequel greenlit and Zack Snyder had so much difficulty getting more movies made in the DC Universe?! That tells me that somehow there is someone with money that has more cash then sense and somehow got talked into making more of this...I will definitely & absolutely NOT recommend this movie for anyone in any form! Not even if you're high or drunk, this is just a pure waste of time that you will never get back.",1/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"Talking about ""Winnie the Poo: Blood and Honey"" carries a lot of negativity, it's not the worst horror movie I've ever seen but it's bad enough, the script is empty and full of nonsense dialogues and incoherent actions, whose only attraction is to see two famous characters from the animation as villains. The cast tries to do their best but the way their characters were written fails to make them stand out, giving only flat performances. The make-up effects are efficient but the computerized blood that oozes from the victims is quite unreal and detracts from the gore. The cinematography in the exterior locations is the most successful as it achieves a gloomy atmosphere. A bad movie with a couple of good scenes.",4/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"Let me start by saying that I went into this expecting it to be very, very bad, but sometimes that makes for a fun watch so I was open-minded. Literally the ONLY decent thing about this movie is the score; everything else, the acting, the writing, the plot, the complete and utter lack of even so much as an ATTEMPT at character development, was a complete mess. It's not one of those horrors that are ""so bad it's good"", it's just painful to sit through from beginning to end. Full of plot holes, completely lacking a protagonist, full of characters who are uninteresting and un-likeable, I can't imagine how anybody could enjoy this movie.",1/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"If there are any ""real"" directors reading this; there is clearly an interest in a Winnie the Pooh horror. This isn't it.I don't even know where to start in expressing the sheer disappointment of this ""film"". What's worse, it doesn't appear to be an issue about the low budget - more the direction. We have all seen recently what can actually be achieved with a small budget. It would appear this ""director' got very lucky with an interesting idea, but has no idea how to actually make a film.Our cinema was about half full, but after 45 minutes I would guess half of those had left. Not because it was scary or gory or too intense - but, my guess, and along with us, bored out their minds. By about an hour in the rest of the audience had broken into conversation. We left with about 15 minutes left as just couldn't take another second.On the way out I asked for a refund (never done that before lol). The guy behind the counter laughed and said a couple others had said the same thing.So what's wrong with it? Well, first and foremost its not scary. It's also not funny or clever or interesting or well shot. It drags on and on with super bad acting, awful music, bad editing, bad camera work, dreadful lighting, terrible dialogue, super cheap looking costumes.... and I could probably go on.Sometimes bad films can be a cheesy, campy good time but the absolute killer here is - it's boring.The world of horror has some absolutely fantastic up and coming directors and its a shame someone with some talent didn't have this idea and execute it properly. But as Winnie is now public domain, maybe someone will.And, somebody needs to ban these people from ever making another film. And, I want my money back.As I was writing this review I came across a review in the Daily Beast by Nick Schager (full credit to him for the below and the full article can be found online/socials) that puts it so much more eloquently than I have been trying to:""Frake-Waterfield exhibits minimal skill at framing a unique or unnerving shot, effectively transitioning between scenes, or eliciting jolts though canny cuts or audio cues. He's not helped by Vince Knight's muddy, shaky cinematography and Andrew Scott Bell's comatose score, which loses steam at precisely the moments that is should be punctuating the action.Its difficult to fault the musicians for their lethargy, however, in light of the omnipresent amateurishness on display, almost none of which can be blamed on production constraints; though its clear that Winnie the Pooh Blood and Honey was made on a shoestring budget, its failings have to do with a simple lack of talent both in front of and behind the camera.In the weeks leading up to Winnie the Pooh Blood and Honey's premiere, the writer/director has expounded on his plans to film a series of additional children's lit horror shows, with Bambi and Peter Pan next in line for the grim dark treatment. On the basis of this fiasco, however, that feels like so much wishful thinking. For all of Pooh's kills, the greatest casualty of his rampage may just be Frake-Waterfield's career prospects"".",2/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"Let me make it clear that I'm not offended by the idea of a Winnie the Pooh horror movie. Such a movie isn't going to ""ruin my childhood"". However, this particular Winnie the Pooh horror is very bad. It starts off explaining how Christopher Robin found and befriended genetic freaks called Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, Rabbit and Owl. They remained friends until Christopher went off to college and left them to fend for themselves. Unable to find enough food, the rest of the animals killed and ate Eeyore, which led to them becoming feral and taking a vow of silence. This part of the movie was adequately done, but it was all downhill from here. The rest of the movie has two men in unconvincing Winnie the Pooh and Piglet masks going around killing people in gruesome ways. What happened to Rabbit and Owl? I don't know, they were nowhere to be found. This movie is bad, and it's way too grim to be enjoyably bad.",1/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"There are some cases of movies in which just by seeing the poster you have a good glimpse of what you are going to watch. There's no point in me doing a synopsis, because if for some sick reason you've ever dreamed of a movie where Winnie the Pooh (yes, the bear from your childhood) goes psychotic and on a killing spree, that's just what you're going to get in this movie.I want to clarify something, being objective this is not a good movie even remotely. As far as slashers are concerned, it is quite mediocre, although it has some brutal deaths at the end, it is overshadowed by films such as Terrifier.So why do I give it a 7? Because the plot, although it is quite stupid, is very funny at the same time, seeing the fat bear torture and kill its victims. It's something worth seeing, even if it's just out of curiosity. The funniest thing is that the movie itself is not a comedy, it might seem like it takes itself seriously and that makes it all the more fun. Also, I must say that Piglet's squeals give the film a plus.In short, the best way to watch this movie is to understand that it's one of those so bad it's good movies, and not take it seriously at all. If you don't find the idea of Winnie the Pooh killing people at least a bit fun, you should do well by skipping this one.",7/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey(2023) is a movie that I watched tonight in theatres.

Pooh and and Piglet have had to resort to extreme methods for survival and resent Christopher Robin for their actions. As Christopher Robin feels guilty for deserting his friends he heads back to see if his memories are real. His actions may unleash hell on Earth.This picture is directed by Rhys Frake-Waterfield (The Killing Tree AND the upcoming Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey 2 AND Peter Pan's Neverland Nightmare) and stars Gillian Broderick (Alive), Paula Coiz (Tooth Fairy Queen of Pain), Chris Cordell (Curse of Humpty Dumpty 2) and Craig David Dowsett (Area 51 Incident).This film had so much potential - great settings, characters, soundtrack, use of lighting, soundtrack and background music. I really enjoyed the sets; unfortunately, the acting and dialogue was mediocre to really bad. The scenes were so inconsistently executed. The opening kills before the credits, torture scenes and hot tub scenes could have been so much better. The ""I love you"" and pool kill are absolutely awful. I will say the ladies are gorgeous and the topless red head kill was awesome...but we needed way more of that. The masks worked for me but I could see why people may complain about them. The bee CGI sequence wasn't good.Overall, this is a movie that had the ingredients to be good but the budget to mess it up. I would score this a 4/10 but would still highly recommend it.",4/10

How are they going to show Winnie and friends. Flick starts really well with a cartoon about the friendship but after 2 minutes things already go wrong, Christopher is leaving the 100 acre woods and Winnie and friends become evil. End of the cartoon and the movie really starts.Couldn't say start because the opening scene takes ages; The main problem with this flick, most of the scene's are way too long. Editing?But not only that is a prob, the acting is way below mediocre and the way the girls react to situations is really unseen.Of course the director do knows the classic tricks, add a bit of nudity and sexy bath tub scene's and people will be happy. But it's a horror so is it scary?It's not scary but what it do offer are some nasty gory killings. The red stuff is available.So for me it wasn't that bad after all, but still under mediocre.

This has been described to me as ""a perfect experience for fans of B movie slashers"" and that's exactly what I got. I'm glad I saw the movie in theaters (Mexico City) because I had a complete blast.I think they pulled this off by being in on the joke. It almost plays as a satire of the slasher craze from the 80's. They knew they were making a Winnie the Pooh slasher and they leaned hard into the premise. I laughed, I was shocked (the deaths are all super fun and creative), and I was impressed by the cinematography and music (especially for this budget which I think is probably less than $100k). In short, it's just a good time if you know what you're signing up for.Similar to Terrifier 2, this is a super low budget horror movie getting a huge amount of attention and press and that's so exciting to me as a lifelong horror fan.

Right now I can seriously say I'd have paid $100 to not have seen it.Woefully acted by what seems to have been cheap labour from the local University drama class. Dismal sound and editing.Sometimes it was like the 10 day shooting time wasn't enough so they inserted re-shoots in to scenes using a different camera, different mic, and different sound design tech,
A lean 84min run time fluffed-out with plenty of long shots that try to create tension and suspense that end up simply having the viewer cry ""Hurry it up!""

Most of them were of limited budget.Another thing and IMDB need to stop this, all the 8, 9 & 10 star votes are from people associated with this car wreck of a movie in one way or another.Now onto the movie itself, this one should be missed by everyone, why?Well the acting didn't bother me so much as I didn't expect much from it in the first place.This film is bad, from the story line to the 'let's get a lesbian couple in here, so people will think we are a modern film' brigade.It could have been such a great fun film and it wasn't.The death scenes were tiresome, the so called blood scenes were barely visible. Pooh and Piglet just looked as if two actors just went to a joke shop and bought some cheap masks.Will this poor attempt of a film get a sequel, I suppose it will but I won't rush to see it.Do yourself a favour and give this one a very wide berth and don't waste you time.",1/10

The acting, the storytelling, the characters, the animation, literally EVERYTHING.At this point, I think we all knew that the movie wasn't going to be an Oscar award winner, but the director utterly trying to do something decent with this movie (as he knew he was making money just because of the title) is pretty much disgusting.We had movies like Terrifier 2 which, despite of having a poor storytelling and a low budget, were fun and got us attentive to what happens next. This? This is pure trash.",1/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"So, I definitely didn't expect this movie to be good at all going in to it.. but I guess I didn't expect it to be quite as bad as it is. I was still excited for it because I love horror that's basis is twisting a happy fairy tale into something dark. This just totally missed the mark in every way though. The setup for the story was so bad, it was just a voiceover explaining the backstory, then Christopher Robin comes in with his wife and the acting is just awful. They die almost immediately so the rest of the movie is just pointless. There's no story really beyond that. All the acting is awful, the characters are lame. The villains are just two guys in masks that aren't scary at all. They didn't even try. The gore was a let down. The movie was too dark to see what was going on half the time. The sound sucked. The writing was awful. I turned it off halfway through and I almost never do that with films, despite having watched plenty of truly awful movies. I really wanted any little redeeming quality for this movie to be able to throw in here but unfortunately there's nothing going for this film. The ONLY thing that's good is the idea of twisting this classic tale. Hopefully someone else takes the idea and does it better than this crew.",1/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"Christopher Robin (Nikolai Leon) goes off to college and returns five years later. His animal friends brew hungry and had to eat some of their own. The decided never again to talk to humans and to hate humans especially Christopher Robin who left them. When Christopher returns to the 100 acre forest with his wife Mary (Paula Coiz) things don't go well as Mary as she becomes fodder. A group of young female adults go up to a cabin to unwind. These are the pretty screamers who can not run or fight that well. They encounter Pooh (Craig David Dowsett) and Piglet (Chris Cordell) and the screen turns dark and bloody.The film tried to be sexy with some tease near nudity. The creatures are men in very cheap costumes, like those Easter Bunny films. The plot was basic, too basic.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",1/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"When I first heard about this movie, I thought it was going to be a comedy or spoof, and then I saw it was classified as a horror film. Of course I was curious and just had to see it. I didn't have great expectations but I absolutely loved it! There was a lot of people in the theater and everyone was laughing, even when somebody got killed - especially when somebody got killed - because they did such stupid things it's almost like they deserved it. It was like they were paying homage to the slasher films of the 80s. It was just so bad that it was great and if it ever comes out on DVD, I want it!",8/10
Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey (2023),"Great idea for a horror film, this could have been ridiculously funny and scary at the same time but the film was quite flat. I was expecting a funny slasher movie but it was dissapointedly bland, I wanted more laughs or suspense.I don't expect much from this type of genre but I think the plot could have been developed more, I found the story quite plain, they don't tell much but just a little bit at the very beginning.I appreciated that the film doesn't use the unexpected loud noise to make the watcher jump from the seat. More suspense in the chasing scenes would have been better too. I also appreciated the British accents accordingly to the story.There's no proper conclusion to the story, at the end of the film it feels like something else needed to wrap up, it just abruptly finished.Watch if curious to see Winnie the Pooh as a killer. Can't deny it was a great idea for a horror film.",3/10

I usually give a film a chance even if bad rating etc but I turned this off as was that bad There are many films out there that are terrible but this words cannot say how bad it is.

Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"The strong suit of the first Avatar movie was for sure not the story (the retelling of Pocahontas in a sci-fi context etc. - my rate for that one is a straight 8), so I did not expect a sophisticated plot or something substantial, and like expected, the story is nothing worth to mention or remarkable. Fore sure, The Way of Water is no bad experience, the effects are fine, the production superb, so I dare to say, if you liked the first one you will like this one most likely too. All in all I was entertained, but the trip had some lengthy parts too, some cutting (like in many productions these days) would have done some magick to the experience of The Way of Water. Also the sensation of the new style like movies like the first Matrix, Sin City and Avatar provided is gone - you know what you get. So I gotta confess, here and there I was slightly bored, and sometimes it was like watching the cinematic to a (well made) computer game. In my humble opinion, the media mostly does overpraise this work by James Cameron like they did with the Dune remake by Denis Villeneuve. Eye-candy? Yes. Cinematic masterpieces? No.",6/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"This sequel has a design and look that matches the first film but it no longer has the same impact. While the ocean setting brings new creatures for us to marvel at - it isn't as breathtakingly new as it was 13 years ago.There are a lot of action set pieces and all of them are great to watch, although they feel either repetitive or borrowed from previous Cameron films like Titanic.For me, bringing back both the Grace character and the evil colonel felt too much. One of them, Grace (Sigorney Weaver), would have been sufficient, the Colonel could easily have been a brother like in Die Hard 3, although this would require additional story changes regarding the adolescent « Spider » character. But that would have been better than the whole « importance of Family » theme running through everything. Just too much of that for me, as well as let's make sure only incidental characters die.The 3D and higher frame rate aspects added nothing extra for me, and at times made it feel like video and not like a real film - although interestingly this video feel was not always there like in the Hobbit films, but would come and go.The story of this film becomes a battle between Jake and the cloned Colonel, with the rest of the global aspect of Pandora verses Humans dropping by the wayside. It would have been more interesting if the new antagonist, not a clone of the Colonel, disobeys his orders from the General and goes AWOL to hunt down Jake - like Captain Ahab and the white whale.",7/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"It's a James Cameron film, so it's impressive. The special effects, camerawork, world-building, and action were all off the charts. But Avatar: The Way of Water struggles like its predecessor in the story and character development departments. In fact, the story of The Way of Water is almost identical to the first Avatar. Instead of humans learning to be Na'vi and then fighting Stephen slang, a family of forest Na'vi learns to be ocean Na'vi and then fight Stephen Lang. All the strengths and weaknesses of the first movie are back in this one, with the bonus of being compared to the original. It really is a visual feast and special effects masterpiece, but just like the first Avatar, that's all it is.",6/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"So, the dumbest thing they could have possibly have dones...they did within the first few minutes of the movie. Not 1, not 2, but 3 completely unbelievable events. They clone the Colonel in a avatar form...and he has a human son also on planet, and Sigorney Weaver has a daughter, even though she is dead...Did i miss anything. Is there anyone out there that actually liked this beginning?I think the Colonel should have been the main character. He could have fallen in love with Pandora just as Jake did and we could have seen that hey, everyone who goes to this planet gets changed. But no, they just wanted a generic bad guy and nothing more. An old rival. But the problem with this is there are already plenty of people that think like this, we even saw them on screen, but they are only shown once and never again. The movie actually started off following the Colonel after being resurrected, and we think thats where the movie is heading but it was just for one shot then it moves on.So they don't have a very good reason for leaving the forest. The forest has been under attack for years but now lets leave because im sure they will stop if we leave.. More like an ostrich with its head in the sand. If we dont see it its not happening.You know what one line kinda ruined the movie for me. When they killed the whale and said this stops human aging and is the only reason why we are on this planet...What?!! WHat about unobtanium. Or did you really forget that is the only reason why you are on the planet..or to terraform and kill all the natives was another reason thrown out there. But its like Cameron completely forgot about unobtanium, and so did all the humans.And by the end of the movie we are exactly where we started. Humans are still on pandora, nothing was solved, nothing was resolved. Why make a movie that has no point?",4/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"James Cameron brings the biggest disappointment of the year. Avatar 2 is nothing but empty beauty.We start with a hurried introduction to the plot through some narration. Jake is a happy dude and he's made some kids somehow. None of this is explained well because apparently it doesn't matter. People are here again and they're evil again, for reasons. Jake flees to a beautiful water world and we never hear of the forest world after that. It's probably being destroyed, but who cares about the genocide of their former tribe? Jake doesn't. His son is touching a whale he shouldn't touch so that's way more interesting. For some reason humanity sends Miles' clone after Jake, spending massive amounts of money to hunt him down even though the objective was only to stop Jake from creating an uprising, which has already succeeded. Jake was laying low in hiding but for some reason they hunt him down still.For a three hour movie, Avatar 2 feels rushed quite often. Subplots are introduced or hinted at and then get thrown away without resolve and big plot points feel rushed, but we do get to spend half an hour watching a completely unnecessary whalehunt. We're supposed to get attached to Jake's new kids but the only one that shows some depth of character is the one that gets bullied and punished for it over and over, even by his own father. It's very hard to feel attached to any of the characters because they're all shallow husks. Dialogue is absolutely horrendous and rarely gets any deeper than ""Come on bro, we gotta do this bro, it's for family bro"". The overuse of ""bro"" is maddening and brings the already terrible dialogue down to sub-zero levels. None of the interactions feel natural. Spider as a character is the epitome of this. He is not only horribly cast but added absolutely nothing to the plot. All he did was politely ask Miles to stop killing a few times. The character in this movie that shows the most depth and development is a whale. I'm not kidding.The ending is extremely lackluster. The new water tribe is just discarded entirely. There's no big fight where the water tribe helps out their new friends in their cool watery ways. They join Jake on the ride there and then they just disappear and we get a rehash of the beginning fight with the same five people we've been watching for the past two hours doing the same things they've always done. Once again, the only character saving this fight is that same whale. In the end the new waterworld setting and all the people in it are nothing but a beautiful background instead of something that actually plays into the plot and characters.Is it all bad? No. Avatar 2 looks amazing. The action scenes are stunning and the water world with all it's majestic creatures is beautiful. But that's all there is. It's empty beauty with no substance at all. And to me, that might just be the biggest disappointment of the year, movie-wise.",5/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"It's hard to believe the sequel to Avatar has actually come out. After 13 years and what feels like half-a-dozen delays, it's officially here.As someone who was surprised by how much that 2009 movie held up on a recent viewing, and therefore had high expectations for a sequel, I'd say it lived up to the hype. Maybe it's a little less great, but I'd have to sit with it a little while longer before I could be sure.First of all, this movie is long. 192 minutes long. I didn't feel the length, in all honesty. I got wrapped up in the movie and how it looked and sounded so much that it probably could have gone on another hour and I still wouldn't have felt restless. It's one of the best-paced 3+ hour movies I've ever seen... and you could argue it's even paced a little too fast in the first act, thanks to a time-skip that means the viewer has to be caught up to speed quickly.Visually and effects-wise, it's perfect. Numerous expensive blockbusters are released every year, but few are given the time that Avatar 2's clearly been given. As such, it looks leagues better than any other $100 million-plus movie released in the last few years. The 3D is great (not something I'd say often), and it finds stunning new areas of Pandora to explore, thanks to the extensive underwater scenes.Story-wise, I'd say it's a little less predictable than the first, which has a story that seems to bother some people. If anything, James Cameron might only be criticised for borrowing too much from himself - introducing child characters made me think of Aliens and Terminator 2, while parts of the action scenes in Avatar 2 will look a little familiar to anyone who's seen Titanic, The Abyss, or even Terminator (1984).There's a little corny dialogue, a couple of slightly clunky scenes early on, and a lack of a definitive climax, seeing as there are more sequels planned. There are problems, but they barely matter. The strengths of this movie are overwhelming, and make this a must-watch in cinemas. It just felt great to see a blockbuster like this again; it's been a while.",9/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"Technically gorgeous, but the story is similarly emotionally manipulative without really thinking through the colonial themes, making it recursive of the first - even with the exact same antagonists, which get more screen time despite that being used little to no effect, except to perpetuate similar circumstances for the next movie. How exasperating. LET THE BAD GUY GO FFS. The kid saying bro every five seconds was excruciating. Why would they have the same vernacular as 20th century people? Why would the kid have that affectation when no one else uses it? It's so stupid.It is bloated, indulgent, and repeats the same criticisms with a bullheaded script that feels like it knows that and spits in the face of it.

NOT at all!The bad: it's all about the pretty visuals and there is very little to none real humanlike soul and subtletly. It's all about ""look how impressive this explosion looks"" and this one and that one. This movie has got SO many EXPLOSIONS and attacks that it started to numb my senses after 20 minutes. That's no way to tell a story!The biggest fail of this movie is that it hasnt got any breathers. In real life, there is a build up in suspense, in this mindnumbing blockbuster there is only one gear: MORE MORE MORE CGI special effects. And it is TEDIOUS to watch till the very end!I simply cant relate to these ugly looking fanstasy characters. I tried to recognize them, but I simply couldnt. There were too many of them. I got lost... honest.The story is non existent, it's just one explosion or attack after the other.Only suited for gamer kids.

Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"If you loved the first movie, you are likely to love this too. This movie too has a thin story, very basic dialogue, and has a very simplistic outlook on life and story. And yet, again as the first one, this movie is beautiful, the story is about family and love, and Cameron just know how to pull those strings. This is what Hollywood used to be so great at and clearly Cameron is one of the last true directors of tinseltown.I am not completely sold on this. I think the movie is too long, I think the simplistic worldview with no shades of gray, and the somewhat cringe dialogue reduces the score too much for me to fully enjoy this spectacle. However this is very entertaining, it is stunning to look at, and I will give this a lot of props for the feel of the movie. There is just something about this experience that gets to you, and as I mention initially the magic of the first movie is definitely still there. This will be the biggest box office of the year for sure, but I cannot say it was a great movie to me.I gave it a 7/10 and I do highly recommend this, especially if you loved the first one, but I find the movie a bit too cheesy to be anything great...but I felt the same about the first one so...",7/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"Without question, this has the best CG works I have seen in recent movies.. Visuals are outstanding.. Underwater sequences and the fight scenes felt very real.. And that's all to it.. Just because it's a visual masterpiece, I cannot spend continuous 12-15 minutes just watching the underwater animals.. It felt like watching some episode from National Geographic or Animal planet..Overall, if you cut 30-40 mins of such parts, you will still not miss anything in the story line.. First half was mostly to setup the environment and was very lagging .. I was like ,""Okay.. I get it.. it's a great place with different creatures.. Now, please move on to the storyline.."".. Climax fight portion was good but not as great as the Avatar 2009 climax fight.. After the fight we still get some 5-10 mins of lagging scenes.. ""Come on ... Finish it already""...A major plot hole that I would think of is the reason for the presence of humans on Pandora.. What happened to the reason from part 1?!

Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"He did it again. And I don't even really understand how. He has some kind of mysterious, special power that he secretly wields over us and we don't even notice. That's how he keeps tricking us into spending all our hard-earned money to see his movies, so much so that we've made him the most commercially successful director of all time. Because these are James Cameron's most typical trademarks, for pretty much all of his movies, which he has once again dutifully employed in Avatar 2:~ The story is paper-thin.~ The dialogue was written by a 16-year-old intern.~ The soundtrack is unbelievably cheesy.~ The lead actor has no discernable acting skills.~ The bad guys are all 100% completely evil, and the good guys are all but entirely saintly.~ The message and moral of the story are about as subtle and nuanced as a jackhammer.And yet.....IT'S SO DAMN COOL.The world he and his visual design team have created is truly a work of art... It's stunningly beautiful, creative and inventive and it makes you want to be there so badly, it hurts. The action sequences are reliably awesome as always, and there are some truly heartfelt emotional passages. In all honesty, the story is awfully predictable, and an almost step-by-step rehash of the first movie. But it's damn near impossible to be bothered by this, because the magic is there, and it's real. And the whales... Oh my god, the whales. Or whale-like creatures, anyway. Absolutely spellbinding. The familiar characters are precisely the same as they were before, and it makes the past 13-year wait seem like nothing at all. It's like meeting with friends you haven't seen for a while. I especially love Zoe Saldaña, she was always the shining star of Avatar, and she's just as mesmerising here, even if her screentime is a bit shorter. The new characters are all good, strong additions to the whole. Cliff Curtis is very powerful as the Sea People's chief, and Kate Winslet is absolutely unrecognisable as his mate, which is as big a compliment as I can think of.But the biggest, and most pleasant surprise, are Jake and Neytiri's children. All but one, played by young, virtually inexperienced actors who all understand their assignments perfectly. They are, without exception, lovely and engaging and very real. They each have to deal with their own respective troubles that come with their coming of age, and all these young performers were cast perfectly. I loved them. The ""but one"", however, is one of the most surprising character/performer pairings I've ever seen. Sigourney Weaver plays a 14-year-old. Yes you read that right. And it's amazing. She's amazing, it's all amazing...Damn James Cameron. If he was a superhero, his name would be Magic Movie Man.",9/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"I should preface this by saying I'm a huge James Cameron fan. T2, Titanic, and Avatar are all on my list of top ten movies of all time. Iconic, timeless, suspenseful, exciting, and heartwarming. Cameron has established himself as a brand producing epic, quality movies. This one, however, was very... mediocre. Unlike all his other movies, there really isn't anything special about this. The Abyss had the breakthrough liquid animation, T2 had the T-1000, Titanic had the epic scale and love story, and Avatar 1 had the revolutionary graphics, 3D, and great story. Way of Water doesn't have anything that really stands out. The opening 15 minutes felt very choppy and failed to create any emotional traction for Sully's new family. The motives for the characters are questionable and also very volatile - one minute they're angry at someone or something, then next minute they're helping them (Quaritch burns villages, kills na'vi's is dismissive and apathetic towards Spider, but when Spider is threatened, goes soft all of a sudden for a ""son"" he doesn't even know) . The use of violence, especially by Quaritch, is completely illogical, pointless, and serves as nothing but a lame attempt at shocking audiences (i.e. Burning the metkayina village. What?!). The personalities and actions of the characters, especially the children, are also annoying. They fail to communicate and explain things, leading to constant misunderstandings, fail to listen, and constantly cause havoc. It's another weak attempt at depicting the ""angst"" of teenagers but it just doesn't track. The editing is also poor, and scenes feel like they're stitched together. One moment you're seeing Jake and his family practicing something or enjoying themselves, then you'll see a random scene with Quaritch, then back to the other na'vi. There's also no epic battle/finale that the whole movie builds up to like the first one. In Avatar 1, you can see how things start off peaceful, how RDA tried to have a peaceful resolution by the schools and sending in Jake, how things slowly escalate, home tree being destroyed, and the gradual need for all-out war at the end. Here, the kids get captured, there's fight, they move, there's happiness, then a fight again, another kidnapping, and finally, they fight the whales, then Jake and Quaritch have a fist fight. Everything just feels weak and loosely wound, with no conclusive event from a steady buildup of tension. The last thing is that there's a fair bit of recycled dialogue, camera angles, and motifs from the first. The ending is an example, where Sully says ""now i know, this is where we take a stand"". Didn't he learn that from the first one?! He went to all-out war fighting for his land, forgets about that in this one, tries to run away throughout the movie, then comes back to that realization.Overall, it just wasn't a memorable, special movie. It felt like they were using the stunning visuals as a crutch for the weak story and characters. I would've been much more exciting if there was a new villain that was much more formidable that wasn't human, and maybe they would have to team up with the humans to fight it. Instead, they recycled the Quaritch and Grace characters like they had no more new ideas. It would've been nice if this ended up like the Dark Knight or T2, both of which built off the first movie and took it to a whole new level of suspense and storytelling. Unfortunately, this just doesn't deliver, and is frankly, forgettable.",3/10

A few humans stay on the planet after the previous incursion, and a few years later, the entire native culture speaks, thinks, and behaves like US high-schoolers.

Could have just watched Nat Geo if i wanted to watch bright lights under water. Complete waste of time.When the story did start it was a complete duplicate of the first. With the same hardships and battles. How this movie took 10 years to make is beyond me.Ive always defended Camerons films but this one is just a let down.

Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"Okay. I'm just gunna write from my heart here on this one, mainly because that's what was impacted most by this ""movie"". We call it a movie, but for me, and my ENTIRE family, sitting in an imax theatre with the sound blasting, the visuals in our faces via the perfectly implemented real 3D, this was more an experience than just a movie. And I really feel confident that I'm not exaggerating when I say that.Is this the most complex, well written, nuanced story ever created? No. Is this a movie that does a massive amount to improve on the writing from the first movie? Well, not really, but kind of. Is this a movie that has a bunch of characters you'll absolutely adore by the end and remember forever? No, outside ot one particular character, which I loved a great deal. Sigourney nailing it.Does this movie need to be or have any of the things I mentioned above to be an amazing experience that will draw the breath out of your lungs, and part your lips in utter disbelief at what you're seeing and, at times, almost FEELING? NOPE.This movie needs to be exactly what it is. An experience almost essential to be had in the biggest, baddest, bells and whistles attached theatre screen you can possibly get yourself into. This is a 10 out of 10 CINEMA experience. As a movie, watched on its own, at home on your smaller screen, streamed or otherwise, I'd say its a 7.5 or 8/10. Similar to the first movie which I think is okay... maybe a 7.My opinion on this movie is, if you're a person that can sit in the theatre with the 3D and surround sound, imax and whatever else, watching the film, and come out of the other end totally unaffected, you're a miserable person that's just looking for something you'll never find.After the last few years we've endured as a species, the 3 hours of magic this film provides, in a good theatre, was more than enough to leave me, the entire group I was with, and the entirety of the audience I sat within, with huge smiles and the occasional teary eye upon the credits rolling. A buzzing atmosphere walking out with people looking more amazed than I've seen since Spider man NWH.I don't care what say about plot, story, whatever, try to be less miserable. This WAS an experience I and many others won't ever forget, and I can't wait for the next one.10 of 10, PLEASE SEE IN CINEMA BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.",10/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),I saw the first one which was fantastic. I wasn't sure what to expect given the mix of ratings but took a risk. The cinema room had about 5% of seats occupied for the film. One couple left part way though.It became clearer during the film based on the characters and dialogue that the target audience is young teens and parents.Something that can be applauded is the creativity of the wildlife animations.Fight scenes created some excitement but didn't lift the film out of the muddy waters. The really dull plot spoilt the film and made it very tiresome to watch.Now I'm wondering how many of the 9 and 10 star ratings are real. It's making me question my trust in imdb.,3/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"One truly leaves this movie wondering, did they write a rough draft script 13 years ago and work only on filming and technology during the time between? And why was this over 3 hours... HA!Something that is even more unimaginable and incredible than Way of Waters visuals is the writing negligence. It is so obvious what did and didn't work in the film. It also feels like these issues should have been hilariously obvious when boarding the screen play or script reading. There are a lot of these issues too. This feels so much like the disaster of Lucas's full creative control of the prequels. James does have a reputation for being intense, but does anyone in his circle have the courage to be like, ""Hey GOAT, this just doesn't work here...""While many fans and non fans will attack the plot, for many reasons and in many areas, the dialogue is straight out of ""uh?"" as well. I imagine even non critics will find themselves asking time and time again, ""Really, that's the line you wanted the character to say... lol?""So big surprise. The story is forced, cliché, environmental, devoid of any creativity, filled with logic leaps, and deep plot holes. The film will most certainly be a huge win for families in the holiday season. If you are looking an intelligent script that hooks you with as much feeling and emotion as the first, look elsewhere. If you wanted a story more compelling and richer than the first, look elsewhere. If the sorta cringe ideas and dialogue dragged the first film down for you, lol definitely look elsewhere. Way of Water seems to be twice as bad in the areas it shouldn't be and twice as good in areas it was already amazing - visuals.This truly feels like a sports car that is trying to take off without an engine. Engine = script.Thank you for reading.",4/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"This film is visually stunning. It simply has to be seen on the biggest screen possible in 3d. That's the best way to enjoy this film just let it consume you. The story is one that most people can get behind and it's enhanced by the visual storytelling on screen. I haven't looked at the film in detail because so much happened and it was so visually engulfing. I'm not saying the story is perfect but the 3 hour+ runtime helped flesh out all of the characters and give the story depth and weight that you only really get with TV series theses days.Honestly there could be a few plot holes but I don't really care. If you're looking to nitpick this movie then maybe you should rethink your life just and enjoy one of the most gorgeous pieces of art this world has ever produced. Just think of how much work was put into this and how amazing it feels.This film has got to be one of the best cinema experiences I've ever had probably along with 1917, Dunkirk, the original Avatar and the re-release of Akira. I know I haven't seen 2001 in imax so maybe that would knock this film out the park but who knows.I'm probably gonna see this movie 3 or 4 more times at least in imax even if it means I'm broke it's just one of those films that is just breathtaking.",9/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"Fake crying, fake smiles, unnecessary moaning and random CGI shots that instead of taking the story forward make you forget that you are not watching a cheap documentary but a Sci-Fi movie...There is not even one dialogue worth remembering for next 5 minutes, character building is so bad that director and writers forgot that biggest strength of Navi people was that they were disciplined and loved their culture. Instead James throws in some teenage drama queens as if the Human DNA of Jake has totally polluted the Navi DNA and now they are no different from the nagging and complaining people of New York or Tokyo...Absolutely waste of time and total insult to the intellect of the viewer...",4/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"The movie while not fantastic storywise was very enjoyable and well worth going to see it. The visuals where beyond fantastic and makes this years other blockbuster CGI look like a joke. Would recommended strongly seeing it in 3D, while its mostly a novelty that because in most cases its done cheaply as a gimmic. Not in this case .The biggest suprise was how they returned some of the characters from the 1st movie which just fit right in.You either go see it in the cinema (biggest screen possible) or don't bother watching it at all. If your thought is to wait and stream it, save yourself 3hrs and don't bother (unless you have a great home theatre (even then....)",9/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"First off, there is no such thing as a perfect movie because the way we all experience movies is different. Subjective. I want to say that so people understand I have no vendetta against this film or it's maker. I only have MY experience with it.Now then.This wasn't a great movie and I loved the first. Let me make a list:Pros:
CGIThat's really itCons:
Poor pacing. Crippling.Writing. It is less clever than most marvel films. Ouch
""Cinematography"". The angle of scenes, chosen (created) backdrops, were not great. EVERYTHING WAS BLUE - NO CONTRAST. It takes place in the ocean and not just any ocean, but an ocean that looks exactly like ours. It felt like I was on earth for the entirety of the film. If that was the goal then mission accomplished I guess? I understand the director has a love for the sea and you can clearly see that with how much this one imitates our own. But the thing is I didn't feel that way at all about the original Avatar. The forest felt far more alien.I really wanted to love this movie. The first 10min give you loads of necessary exposition for a story that I guess progresses in the next film? For THIS film you simply watch a lot of blue people swim in a lot of water. It's pretty... and it's also pretty boring. It felt like James Cameron had his finger on the trigger after the first 10 minutes and you're waiting for him to pull it but he never does. There was no climax. I was blown away by how underwhelmed I was by everything.Plus every important character (of which there are too many) is wearing so much plot armor that the suspenseful scenes lack any kind of palpable tension.Go ahead, dislike my comment. I kinda want to too tbh. After this long wait I was expecting a better story, that's all. They should have called it 'Avatar 2: Whale Wars'.I'm kidding. Kinda.",5/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"James Cameron has sadly not made a classic, but rather close to a turkey, even if it will be hailed as a masterpiece. Well, I'm sad to say; it isn't - by far!Well, I survived the length... I had time to think a lot along the way, unfortunately. It's skillfully made, but not my cup of tea. I never fall into this one and started to feel like this was close to what I hate with mdern action movies. Is it ia turkey? Or maybe a tulkun, which is some of what this is about (I will not say what a tulkun is so no spoiler).Cameron probably should have stuck to his first script for 2, which he scrapped.I'm a fan of sci-fi movies, but here it's overkill. And I have to ask ot of questions instead. Felt this was a mix of Marvel, Tarzan, Planet of the Apes and a Vietnam movie.I liked Avatar 1 even though the ending ruined it, but this was too much. I see that Cameron is trying to give some messages about the environment and indigenous people, but why do they have to be invincible big and blue, and say ""bro"" all the time?Of course, I struggle with the fact that the film starts when it should end, with an hour-long battle taken out of a Marvel film, with equally tiresome music.It doesn't make up for the fact that it's beautiful, and although the CGI is great, I'm surprised that it's just as bad at explosions. They look cheap. If there was something I thought Cameron would fix, or at least pay for, it sows believable explosions.I wasn't moved by all the sadness either, possibly because they all look weird and are blue or turquoise. I was bored, primarily because I never land in the story. Didn't care if anyone died, and to be honest started wishing more of the in the ""family blue"" dead.Sorry, James! I've probably seen my last Avatar movie too, however many Cameron wants to make. A lot of good, then, but so much that pulls it down that it becomes average; 5/10.",5/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"Seriously, I've just come back from watching the film in the cinema in London and cannot recommend this film. I enjoyed the first Avatar, and was curious to see where the story would go and was also expecting a brilliant visual experience, but the story was a complete repeat of the first film (down to the same 'villain'), and the visuals were no big deal. I had expected MORE, especially after such a long wait for the sequel. The worst thing was how BORING it was, and how lame the plot was. Even the ending sucked. What was Cameron trying to do, rip off Titanic for the ending? Oh and the 'kids' were so irritating. They kept on saying 'bro' this, 'bro' that. Like seriously, I didn't give a damn about them and had expected Sam Worthington's character to still be the centre of the story, not his stupid kids. Oh and don't get me started on the teenage tarzan with dreadlocks kid that did nothing for 99% of the film.Honestly, I really don't believe the great reviews here. They must be PR people writing them or people who have never seen good cinema before. I found it disrespectful to have a repeat of the first film's plot, albeit in a different setting. Not only that, but considering it was so BORING, and had cringeworthy dialogue, and the effects were overrated, I find it hard to believe that anyone would bother giving more than 5 stars, let alone seeing the 3rd instalment when it comes out. I certainly won't. I'm giving it 3 stars because I expected much more from the sequel. It's certainly no Aliens (now there's a great sequel folks).",3/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"James Cameron gives James Bond's Thunderball competition on how many underwater sequences he can fit in a feature length three hour film. As for the movie, it's alright I guess. Retreads quite a bit from the first film and feels more like style over substance in places with pretty shots and CGI. I didn't get the emotional impact from this one as much as the original.Jake and Neytiri get way less screentime as it focuses on the children and secondary characters. It's more blue people and more action. Not sure if it justifies the runtime. Think it could have easily cut out 30 minutes without any problems. The score is decent, although James Horner's absence is noticed. If you wanted more Avatar, this delivers I guess but if you were expecting anything new to the story you'll be a little underwhelmed I think.6/10.",6/10
Avatar: The Way of Water (2022),"I liked it, but it wasnt worth waiting 13 years to see. I dont get how it took 13 years for this to be made. I felt like I was watching Titanic again near the end. It was beautiful, but lacked any real story or anything new. I guess I was expecting so much more waiting so long and having to sit in the theater for so long too. I did cry a little, so I gave it 6 stars, but Finding Nemo was more interesting. The story was weak and cookie cutter I've seen that before kinda thing. Why couldnt we have more animal fighting? I loved that in the first one. I just feel so empty and wish I could have some kind of warm fuzzy feeling and glad I watched it, but I dont think it was worth the wait. I guess I'll be dead before the 3rd Avatar comes out at this rate.",6/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"I am conflicted with this film and with Marvel.Let's review the good first. There is a heartfelt tribute to T'Challa and obviously to the actor who played him. The emotions shown feel real and manage to move. The performances are good in this regard. Angela Bassett stands out above the rest.I'm not one to oppose the replacement of Atlantis by Talokan, as this gives another excellent excuse to show some content that derives from universal culture in gigantic products like the MCU movies. Namor is an excellent addition to the ranks of Marvel superheroes immediately showing how powerful he is and what he is capable of.The action sequences are entertaining, as Marvel has already accustomed us.The wardrobe is also something to value in this film. There is a great effort and meaning behind each of the suits, which successfully try to mix the different cultures with the new times full of technology. This makes an excellent contribution to character design.Now what I didn't like about the movie. The entire story feels too light and if you think about it, pretty ridiculous. Namor's motivations don't match his plans or his actions throughout the film. Marvel Studios again falls flat when writing and developing their villains. It all feels like a mere excuse for the characters to clash. There is nothing really of weight in the story, except for the death of T'Challa, which is also not well used, abusing the drama whenever they can.I liked Riri Williams' introduction, but not Ironheart's introduction. The story devoured her as a secondary character and was relegated to the background when in fact the beginning of the film gives her much more importance.The pacing of the movie is inconsistent. It's pretty monotonous until the action scenes, which are good, but short. Sometimes, there is too much information happening too fast without giving the opportunity to fully appreciate each sequence and each character involved.Finally, the effects are good, as expected, but something is wrong with the composition of the cities. Both Wakanda and Talokan have a contrast and color problem that prevents them from being fully appreciated.The final battle scenario also seems pretty bad to me.Overall, the movie is entertaining if you just want to have fun with fights and visuals, but I think it's about time Marvel got serious about their movies and realized that adults are also consuming superhero movies.",6/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"I never thought the original Black Panther was anywhere near being the best solo Marvel movie, but I did enjoy it and T'Challa's character throughout his appearances. With that being said, when Chadwick Boseman sadly passed, I accepted that this franchise was doomed. I always believed that recasting T'Challa was the only way to go. It would've been incredibly hard to find a good replacement, but the character is very important to the Marvel universe. It is also simply too soon to pass the mantle of Black Panther on. When they confirmed he wouldn't be recast, I felt like it was a big mistake narratively.Now does Wakanda Forever handle the death of T'Challa/Boseman well? Absolutely! Being able to respect the legacy of the actor while also metatextually connecting the event to an in-universe tragedy is definitely one of the movie's standout features. Regardless, I feel like the movie is a little too reliant on the audience being impacted by Boseman's passing.Don't get me wrong, the fully silent opening gave me chills. They incorporated the death beautifully and honorably, but the result is what feels like two movies in one. You can clearly tell the original script was written before Chadwick's death. I really respect Coogler's decision to not recast, but I still wish T'Challa and Namor got to cross paths.My issues spring not from the T'Challa-related parts of the film, but from how the rest feels lacking without his presence. I don't think Shuri works as the protagonist. She was a fun (yet underdeveloped) carefree tech nerd in the original movie and here she takes a 180 to being reserved and bitter. The changes to her character were perhaps necessary for this story, but it doesn't make them good changes for her. Some don't match her at all and her vengeful arc is just T'Challa's from Civil War with a less fitting character. She never struck me as someone who would willingly become the Black Panther and there isn't much impact when she does anyway.Ramonda is a pleasant surprise in this movie. Her monologues are insane. Angela Bassett deserves all the credit she's been receiving. However, Okoye is the only character I felt really connected to and she is stupidly sidelined a third into the movie. She would've enhanced the film a lot if given more screen time. So would've M'Baku, who is completely wasted. Between them and W'Kabi, who is fully absent, we have three characters connected to T'Challa and it isn't explored how his death affected any of them personally. This is one of many missed opportunities that came with trying to focus the movie on both Talokan and T'Challa's death.Some of the action scenes are awesome and some drag. As to be expected from Danai Gurira, Okoye's fight scenes are the tensest we've gotten from Marvel all year.Namor himself is a pretty good villain. In a similar fashion to Killmonger, his actor sells the character for me despite his viewpoints being completely ridiculous. They somehow managed to adapt his crazy mutant powers to live-action in a cool way. Changing his kingdom from Atlantis to Talokan ended up being a really cool idea, even though the place and its people needed more elaboration. There are many more cool concepts they could've explored with the Aztec roots. Hopefully they are saving more about the civilization, the people's powers, and their technology for a Namor project.Ironheart is an even more underdeveloped part of the movie, undoubtedly to save content for her upcoming show. Her character is just as dumb and not relatable as I expected her to be and her suit looks awful. A Black Panther movie didn't feel like the right place to introduce an Iron Man ripoff.Also, Ross's entire storyline felt weird and unneeded. It's only included to add awkward colonizer jokes and set up future MCU films. If he and Ironheart were removed, there would definitely be enough room to have included more from the aforementioned underutilized characters.By the latter half of this movie, the pacing really starts to drag. I've complained recently about Marvel movies like Multiverse of Madness and Love and Thunder being way too short, but this film had no reason to be 2 hours and 40 minutes and feel like it's over 3 hours. There's so much downtime between the action that when the final battle starts, the movie has already overstayed its welcome.The things I'm disappointed they didn't include or flesh out have no excuse to not be here or be better implemented considering how aggressively long and slow the film is.So this definitely isn't a bad movie per se, but it's not fantastic either. It's very bold but very flawed with iffy decisions on what to prioritize and how to structure this challenging project. I was pretty disappointed when I first saw it, but there's some great stuff sprinkled throughout. The lack of T'Challa, awkward pacing, and wasted opportunities easily made it worse than the first movie to me.",6/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"Let's start with the good points - this film doesn't try to be all comedy and spectacle, like the recent Dr Strange 2 and Thor 4. In fact, there is almost zero comedy at all.It does try to bring some drama, and to make some points about the responsibility of nations to use their wealth, resources and technology for global benefit, rather than national advancement.Namor is different to the comics, but once I got past the initial differences, I think the portrayal was a good one. He isn't a one-dimensional villain, his people are descended from the Mayans, and he has proper motivation.But the film has a lot of problems. Firstly, the pacing is all over the place - it should be at least half an hour shorter. The comic-book science is paper thin (Shuri extracts DNA from plant fibres on a bracelet that has been underwater for 400 years, but cannot do the same from the recently dead plant in her lab). Shuri takes a spear right through her stomach and out of her back, but gets over it after a short breather. The Wakandan ship is breached from undersea, tilts over by 45 degrees and then the next scene it is upright and apparently seaworthy again. The fact that Namor's people take mortal wounds but get up again is never explained.And then there is still my biggest problem with Wakanda. Both Black Panther films promote the idea that Wakanda is a Utopian society, both technology and socially. Yet they still choose their leader by who is best at beating up other challengers.I think there was a missed opportunity here. Namor would be more likely to say ""join us, or if not, don't get in our way"", as he plans to attack the rest of the surface world. This would present Wakanda with a far more interesting moral dilemma - standby by and watch untold millions die, or utilise their resources and technology to aid the nations who have been trying to rob them.",6/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"Sorry, but this was boring. Mind-numbing boring. Sleep-inducing boring. ""Are we there,yet?""-boring.Dang, I liked Mr. Bozeman and they pay some propper respect to his character in the first couple of minutes and it really hits you in the feels but after that we are let known that Wakanda have mastered the technology of exposition dialogue. If that is their main achievement then I say we forget vibranium and let them slink back behind their stealth shield and call it a day.They could have done so much with this movie and show Africa as a vibrant place full of ideas and hope in the face of many problems. Maybe explore Ubuntu philosophy, or visual art. Unfortunately, Wakandan culture is reduced to a song&dance number for the day-trip tourists in cinema seats.This was a missed opportunity and almost a missed movie if not for a good double espresso I had before it.",6/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"As the last film in the fourth phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022) proves that there was no plan for this phase other than to clean up the remains of the Infinity War saga. To its credit, though, Wakanda Forever was burdened with finding an in-universe replacement for the titular Black Panther after the untimely passing of Chadwick Boseman. However, considering how most of Phase 4 was passing the mantle from one hero to the next generation, it fits well within this theming.There's a line in Avengers: Endgame (2019) where Naka (Lupita Nyong'o) states that Wakanda is aware of an anomaly on the ocean floor near their country and that they were handling it. This throwaway line was likely played for laughs, but it's peculiar how Wakanda was woefully unprepared for the invasion of their land by underwater enemies, even though they clearly knew about it three years ago. Phase 4 of the MCU has highlighted how difficult it is to maintain continuity in a franchise as huge as it has become.Even though Marvel has introduced new characters in movies outside their own standalone works since the early Phases, I would have liked something more dedicated to introducing Ironheart (Dominique Thorne) considering how influential Iron Man was to the MCU. I also would have appreciated action sequences that weren't so dark or hard to follow, because I can't honestly recall any of them that happened in this movie. Overall, I felt the end of the MCU Phase 4 was average-which aligns with the MCU Phase 4 as a whole. Here's to hoping the next Phase actually goes somewhere.Phase 4 MCU's average movie to end an average phase, I give Black Panther: Wakanda Forever 3.0 stars out of 5.",6/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"The only reason this is scoring a five from me is because of the good CGI, magnificent costumes and wonderful scene shots. Sadly none of that could save this terrible story which the director made it look like he was clueless as what to do with it. Not his fault really as it was woefully lacking in worth, tension, excitement, interest or quality in any way. My personal thoughts as I sat watching it (fighting hard with myself not to just switch it off) was that if they had no creative outstanding story for a sequel then Hollywood should have stopped just trying to cash in on what they thought would be a successful film franchise; whereas instead they made one of the most disappointing rubbish sequels of a film.They spoilt the memory of a great Black Panther and this will most likely do so bad at the box office that there may not be a third film being made in the future. Its the typical cash in if you can, from people involved in the putting together of the fans heroes, from directors and studios who don't give a toss about the Marvel/DC heroes and heroines; they are there too see if they can amass better wages and high end film contracts.In straight forward simplistic words, ""This was a bloody disgrace and only did damage to a superhero that has never had enough exposure!",6/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"Phase 4's MCU comes to a close with Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. It's been a truly inconsistent run of films. There was the good (Shang-Chi, Spider-Man, some of Dr. Strange 2), the eh (other parts of Dr. Strange 2, Black Widow and Eternals), and the ugly (Thor 4, which is easily the worst MCU movie so far). If this movie had been bad, it might have been enough to make me bail on keeping up with the MCU's movies, and truth be told, I've already bailed on the Disney+ series', because WandaVision, Falcon & Winter Soldier, and Loki really didn't do it for me.If you're expecting Black Panther 2 to wrap up Phase 4, you might be disappointed. But then again, there hasn't been a consistent narrative to the last two years of Marvel releases, so there's really nothing to conclude, overall. Importantly, it's just a very good movie, and that's enough to ensure it ends Phase 4 on a high. It's not a total slam-dunk, but there's a great deal about Black Panther 2 that's extremely effective, and enough great stuff that I feel the overall movie is a strong one.I think the pacing is its greatest strength. I really didn't feel the 2 hour 40 minute runtime. The opening half-hour doesn't flow the best, but there was a need to adjust after Chadwick Boseman's passing meant T'Challa died, too. Once the movie establishes this and sets up its main plot, it's pretty smooth-sailing, and unlike many Marvel movies, it saves its most emotional moments and best action scenes for its excellent final hour.It's a very emotional movie, and the way it pays respect to Boseman and T'Challa is essentially perfect. With good action, a solid story, a very good new antagonist (Namor and the whole underworld were great), and fantastic music (maybe the best Marvel score so far?), this was a very good MCU movie, and gives me a little more hope for the franchise going forward.",8/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"I just got out of Black PantherI found it pretty underwhelming. It's a better put together movie than both Thor: Love & Thunder and Doctor Strange & The Multiverse of Madness, and there is no sense it was butchered in the editing room, like both of those movies. That said I probably had more fun with those two.The Chadwick Bosman stuff was touching, but I expected more. Disappointed not to see at least, Bucky there. When I heard there was a cameo, I expected it to be someone at the funeral. I DID NOT see that cameo coming. I thought the Marvel logo was a nice touch.Letitia Wright and Angela Bassett are both good, but I'm not sure where this Oscar nomination talk is coming from. Then again, I didn't think Black Panther should have got a nomination for Best Picture, so she could get one. Winston Duke was a bit wasted as Umkaku, disappointed by what he did at the endThere is no reason for it to be as long as it is. I was bored a few times. I was especially bored during the story between Martin Freeman and Julia Drefuss, it was really weak and unnecessary. Was it just there to put some white people in it? I didn't like the scientist girl, she irritated me and had awful dialogue. Some of the CGI/Green screen work was not the best, too.I can safely say, with the exception of Spider-Man: No Way Home, nothing from Phase 4 will be rewatched, never mind find its way into my collection.Overall I found it OK.",6/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"While Michael B. Jordan and the late Chadwick Boseman stole the show in the first Black Panther, every cast member in this sequel delivers an amazing performance.Letitia Wright in the main role delivers the most range, from grief to fury, far from the cocky savant in other Marvel movies.Angela Basset is supposed to be a queen, but amps it up to Goddess.Danai Gurira takes haughty warrior to the next level, and navigates it through a fairly dramatic arc.The less-melanin-endowed - Tenoch Huerta, Martin Freeman, and Julia Louis-Dreyfus - also bring their a-game, dropping lines like bombs throughout.Everyone has so much swagger that those with slightly less screen time, like Winston Duke, Dominique Thorne, and Lupita Nyong'o are drowned out or do not get the development they deserve.There are so many important characters that some disappear for big chunks of the film. Wakanda Forever, at 2 hours 40 minutes could have been 2 films, though I was never bored.It's a pity that the great performances are poorly supported by forgettable dialogue and clumsy plotting.Even with that handicap, the actors go beyond having chemistry to be more like pieces of flint striking each other and giving off sparks. The tension is picked up by decent camera work, zoom, and framing.Which brings me the worst part for me. The 2:39 extra-wide aspect ratio is best suited to wide Imax vistas, of which the movie has very few. When used on ensemble dramas, the cropping of characters becomes distractingly clear as does the empty space to the sides. (I kept checking my TV settings to see if they were the problem.) It's even wrong for the battle sequences, which instead of being wide line clashes play out vertically, on tall structures or surface-to-sky.Despite these difficulties, Wakanda Forever is full of actors and characters I would love to see again.""Uhambe"" for now.",8/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"This film had some great stuff in it, there's no doubt of that, but I felt it was overall weak. I can't imagine how hard it was for everyone in the film to come back without a lead, and most importantly, their friend. Chadwick's passing is unbelievably sad but it did leave a gap for Marcel to fill, and they could have done it so well. But they didn't.Firstly, the good. All the emotional scenes were well-scripted and well-acted, and I have to commend Angela Bassett and Letita Wright for their fantastic acting. I never cry in the cinema but this film really had me going because it felt from the heart in some scenes, and I am sure it was.I also enjoyed the costumes - wow were they beautiful. The only one I didn't like was the Midnight Angels (or whatever they were called). They didn't feel like they fit. Some of the fighting was great as per.The rest of the film felt slow, boring almost. I've just come from the cinema and I am struggling to remember much of it.The story was gaping with holes and so much was skipped over with little explanation. The beginning when T'Challa dies felt cold and rushed. That should have been the pivotal moment for the story, but it was brushed over. However, maybe it was too hard for the cast and crew to linger on.The Talokan/Atlantis story was odd to me and felt so disconnected from Wakanda. I didn't enjoy that storyline. They could have made it so much better.Anyway, it was enjoyable and I'll maybe watch it again. But I won't rush to do that.",6/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"No need to beat a dead horse, so ill summarize it as bad plot and generic copycat characters.This movie really pushed my boredom to the limits. They spend too much time on ceremonies and fantasy lore and almost no time developing the plot. The spent an inordinate amount of time on character development but I still felt nothing for any of them.This reminded me a lot of the new Dune where the acting seemed ok, and certainly, the movie looked great, but I couldnt care for any of the characters in any way. I felt similarly about Namor and his mermaid people who seemed more like empty plot points than real adversaries.Id skip it.",3/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"Black Panther was a very welcome addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe back in 2018 and I was really looking forward to seeing the progression of that character. Obviously, with the tragic passing of Chadwick Boseman, that just wasn't possible anymore. I figured they would recast the character and continue forward, but they made the tough decision to write the death of the character into the film as well. For that reason, I was worried and relieved all at the same time. It seemed like an impossible task to make a sequel to such a beloved film, but not have the core character there the entire time. Well, after seeing Black Panther: Wakanda Forever, I can confidently say that they handled it as well as they possibly could have. I thought this film was emotional and fantastic, and here's why.Picking up six years after the events of Black Panther (in accordance to the events of Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame), this film focuses heavily on the loss of T'Challa and how the country can move forward without their leader. With the emergence of Namor and the underwater city of Talokan threatening all of Wakanda, the remaining characters must band together and protect their country. Shuri (Letitia Wright) is easily the one with the most screentime here and the burden of carrying this franchise is on her shoulders the whole time. This must have been a daunting task, but she pulled it off. Her character, along with her mother, portrayed incredibly well once again by Angela Basset, are the beating hearts of this film. The emotional aspect of this film got me on a few occasions.Some people may complain about the fact that the death of Chadwick Boseman is basically the jumping-off point for this story to even happen, but I found that it was very tastefully done. With the addition of other characters that will have a future in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this film was filled to the brim with story. Where I might have my only complaint though, is the fact that this feels like a big budget prelude to what will come next. It's a fantastically made film by director Ryan Coogler and I loved watching every minute of this one, but I have to admit that it did feel like more of a long eulogy for the passing of Boseman.With all of that said though, I'm only complaining about that because I'm reviewing it and criticizing it. That complaint isn't something I will regularly say about this film. They take the time to make a great film on top of that, so it really worked for me overall. I can't wait to see where certain storylines continue later and the fact that I'm excited about that, all while this film is satisfying on its own, is nothing short of great. I wept, I was entertained, and I was engaged in the story at hand, so what else could I really have asked for from this film? Also, the final scene that takes place during the credits is easily one of my favourite post-credit scenes in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It was very well handled. Now playing in theatres, I absolutely recommend checking out Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.",9/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"First of all, RIP to Chadwick Boseman. They really did do a good tribute to him in this movie through various devices. Performances when reflecting his death felt real and convincing, probably because there was little ""acting"" involved. Losing a franchise star is really a tough blow. While I felt Boseman's absence, I don't think not all of the movie's downfalls are linked to his absence.Biggest head-scratching moments were for me was poor writing mainly from some of the tactical choices. The whole conflict stems from the existence of Riri (soon to be Ironheart), who built a Vibranium detector for a school project. Apparently, she's the only one in the world who can do that. Aside from that ridiculous premise, I thought Ironheart's introduction to the MCU was not bad (I still think the suit is ugly). She was likable enough and I think she has potential. I do worry about the overlap between her and Shuri because while they do have good chemistry, they are such similar characters. Anyways, this detector triggers a cascade of events where Shuri and Riri are taken to Talokan. First of all, getting rid of Riri will not do anything because the technology is no longer in her hands alone. Also, Wakandans have very little reason to protect her other than the fact she's a great scientist. I was also baffled that key hostages like Shuri and Riri could escape Taloka with the help of one person DURING an ongoing negotiation. A rookie foreign affairs mistake. It was not even a hostage situation. It was closer to an aggressive invitation. This was literally the cause of the all-out war and I thought it was just poorly written how they started that conflict. And at that point, the entire war felt so meaningless and stakeless because it wasn't clear why they were fighting. It still isn't clear why Talokans wanted to go to war with Wakanda. So whatever came after that became difficult to love. Ramonda's death was also quite preventable in my opinion. The queen with no protection and left to drown. Like why does Riri matter so much to Ramonda that she sacrificed herself to save her? It almost felt like an artificial plot device to pump up Ironheart's value as a a character. And Shuri does not blame Riri once or show any animosity toward her even though she was an indirect cause of her mother's death? Seemed a little strange unless she didn't know what happened.There were positive things too. I thought Taloka's story was interesting and was well introduced. Loved Namor as a character and his action scenes were powerful enough. The performances were solid across the board, especially Ramonda and Namor shined. I thought some of the battle sequences were interesting despite being imperfect (really bad CG moments here and there). Overall, it was rather inconsistent with really cool spear fighting scenes and just generic scenes. The whales really did surprise me. I thought the locations were well chosen. I really like their portrayal of Wakanda and Taloka in general so that's a plus. I enjoyed how they incorporated the idea of the oppressed (the Mayans) versus oppressor like they did in Black Panther 1. But again, this should only unite Taloka and Wakanda together rather than fight against each other.I'd also like to comment on Shuri. She has now become the official franchise star with the death of Ramonda and T'challa. My overall impression that while she has the potential to be the franchise but it's a tough transition. She's been known as the geek scientist sister but now she's the black panther and the sole protector of Wakanda. That's a big jump for both the audience and the character. That type of transition, fueled mostly by grief and revenge, should usually take multiple movies or a series to hash out but that was not an option for the production team. So while I still am not used to the transition, I think they were handled as well as they could be. Her characterization was complex and meaningful enough. A far better experience than the most recent MCU movie.In the end, phase 4 has been a let-down for most fans with a notable exception. I was disappointed that this movie was not able to be part of that exception.",6/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"Most boring Marvel movie yetWe understand that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever won't be the same as what it used to carry but still thinking of some flashy action scenes or a few mesmerizing displays of characters which the movie failed to do so.__ The movie felt like more or less a family drama with no strong plot for why the agony started in the first place. So if you want to see people just being emotional while wearing costumes, this movie is just for you._ Also if you are expecting some interesting turns of events that will disappoint you also. The movie goes in the usual MCU ways and does not significantly represent the way a Black Panther movie should be.__ So if you have seen the trailer, you already have seen the whole movie and would find nothing new.A depressing end to a disappointing Phase 4.",2/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"Black Panther: Wakanda Forever has ambitious goals but does not manage to meet them due to its overlong and sometimes unfocused screenplay that often feels very first draft level in craft and trying to have one too many political conversations to streamline linearly. It has its moments, with some very solid dramatic acting work by its performers, but on the whole it is an admirable effort but also a major step down in quality from its predecessor. I personally feel they should have waited on a sequel, and take more time to figure out what to do with the Black Panther and Wakanda as the Marvel Cinematic Universe was progressing post Endgame and after the unfortunate passing of Chadwick Boseman. The loss of T'Challa is seriously felt in this story, and I think most would have been fine with a recast just a few years later, the new actor might not have been on Mr. Boseman's level, but they could have still performed the part well and carry the franchise further. As is, the mantle gets passed, and its executed just okay, but it would have more impact if the story were more focused. Namor is a nice addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and is adapted fine, I would certainly like to see more of him in later installments. Still, you feel that the character probably should have come into the picture a lot earlier on, like in Phase Two or Phase Three at the least.",2/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"If there is one thing BLACK PANTHER: WAKANDA FOREVER gets right is the reverence and respect it gives to the memory of Chadwick Boseman, taken from us way too soon after making the role of T'Challa, the Black Panther, totally and uniquely his own. From the opening montage, where he is the only Marvel superhero whose visage we see, onward throughout the film, his shadow looms over the characters, story, and action. We feel his missing presence in every scene. It is clear that director Ryan Coogler, the returning members of the cast from the first film, and the producers where dealt a very difficult hand when crafting a sequel and finding a way forward. Perhaps it was an impossible chore, perhaps there was no way they could have succeeded under these conditions, but the resulting film was just a disappointment as far as I'm concerned. In the absence Boseman, WAKANDA FOREVER fills the void by elevating the principle female characters to center stage, and having them face off against a threat from Prince Namor, the leader of an undersea race heretofore unknown to the MCU over the issue of vibranium, an all purpose element found in abundance in Wakanda (and the source of its technological superiority), and now for the first time, discovered outside the African nation on the ocean's floor. Coveted by other nations, this sets off a conflict when Namor demands that Wakanda do his dirty work for him, and eliminate the threat from the surface world. I don't fault the actresses-Letitia Wright, Lupita Nyong'o, Danai Gurira, and the indomitable Angela Bassett-who totally give it their all, and clearly bring it. But the script goes heavy on the themes of female empowerment, anti-colonialism, and Afro-futurism that earn praise from mainstream film critics and pop culture commentators at the expense of the tension and conflict, and even humor that made the first film something special. A cameo by Michael B. Jordan's Killmonger in a dream sequence only served as a further reminder of what WAKANDA FOREVER was missing. At a running time of more than two and half hours, WAKANDA FOREVER works way too hard to generate some heat with its thin plot. Namor is played by Tenoch Huerta as another antagonist motivated by past injustice, so he never really feels like a Big Bad. And those wings on his heels look silly. Tweaking Namor's origin to make him and his undersea kingdom have a connection to the ancient Mayans, who escape Spanish oppression by ingesting vibranium, works, but giving all of them but Namor blue skin invokes unflattering comparisons to AVATAR (it didn't help that the trailer for James Cameron's latest epic played in the theater before WAKANDA FOREVER). There are some great action set pieces, something the MCU does well, but the resolution of the final battle between Princess Shuri and Namor is underwhelming. There are a few cameos, and I liked the interplay between Martin Freeman and Julia Louis-Dreyfuss. And was I the only one who thought Richard Schiff was just playing an older version of his character from THE WEST WING when he shows up as the Secretary of State?There is a single mid-credits scene that reveals that the legacy of T'Challa is more than what it first appeared, something I thought the movie was leading toward all along. It opens up a host of possibilities for future BLACK PANTHER films, but I was further disappointed that there is no hint as to where Phase IV of the MCU is heading. That was one of my complaints with THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER and I think the loyal fans are getting restless. Namor is a character with a lot of history with The Fantastic Four, and this would have been an opportunity to give us some idea of how and when they might be introduced into the main MCU. Namor also mentions that he is a mutant, one of the first ones ever in the Marvel universe, raising the possibility of the X-Men showing up-how great would it have been if he'd been approached by Magneto in another after credits scene seeing how their back stories have similarities. Will just have to wait and see what the next Ant-Man movie shows us.",6/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"Wakanda Forever tells the story of how Wakanda got a new Black Panther in a war with the Atlantis (or whoever they were). The film's best parts are the underwater beings who attack Wakanda. Prince Namor is really cool and the actor who plays him has great screen presence. His underwater people are a lot of fun to see in action.The film's big problem is that the lead is insufferable and annoying. She doesn't have a lot of screen charisma, makes a much better sidekick than a main protagonist, and overall it's not that interesting that she ever becomes Black Panther. You never really root for her I this film.Also, this film is mostly boring acting and writing repeating information we already know and everyone being depressed all the time. It's hard to get into a movie that is two hours and forty minutes of this.Probably, it should have just been called Namor and have Wakanda be the side characters.",6/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"" is the sequel to 2018's ""Black Panther"" and the 30th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Directed and co-written by Ryan Coogler (""Fruitvale Station"", ""Creed""), it pays an appropriately sombre tribute to its recently deceased lead actor by showing how things can still move forward in the wake of his absence.One year after the untimely death of King T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), the African kingdom of Wakanda is still in mourning as they struggle without their beloved monarch to lead them. T'Challa's younger sister, Princess Shuri (Letitia Wright), feels the immense pressure to take over as ruler but believes she cannot handle such a huge responsibility all by herself. Not long after, the inhabitants of the underwater civilisation of Talokan, led by King Namor (Tenoch Huerta), emerge to wage a war against the surface world. With limited time remaining, the citizens of Wakanda must quickly overcome their grief to put a stop to the Talokan threat before everything is destroyed.After the unfortunate passing of ""Black Panther"" actor Chadwick Boseman in 2020 due to cancer, the MCU was left with a complicated dilemma - should the sequel recast the lead role with a different actor or should they re-write an entirely new story without him? Either of these options would have been a risky move since audiences have become so familiar with Boseman's portrayal of King T'Challa (a.k.a the Black Panther) that it would be near impossible to accept anyone else in the role. It was soon revealed that out of respect for both Boseman and the fans that the latter option was chosen, with the character's in-world demise intended to mirror the actor's real-life death. Now with the release of ""Black Panther: Wakanda Forever"", we see how all of this has managed to play out, in a follow-up that makes good use of its supporting cast while also remaining respectful to the foundations that have already been laid down.Anybody who saw the 2018 film will remember it has already been established that Wakanda is a place full of interesting characters that have helped this kingdom thrive for so long in seclusion. Because of this, it is believable that its citizens can continue to function without a King due to their personal code of discipline. However, due to their overwhelming admiration for King T'Challa, the Wakandans still feel a sense of emptiness with him no longer being around to lead them and as a result, they are living directionless lives. This is all conveyed to us primarily through the characters that knew T'Challa best and the audience gains a solid understanding of the grief they are each experiencing.I think the film does a decent job of exploring the concept of losing someone you deeply care about, whether it is a close family member or someone you admired from afar. In particular, we get a good look at how Shuri, the next in line to the throne, just cannot bring herself to take her brother's place as the rightful ruler of Wakanda. Despite her lingering heartache, Shuri, along with the rest of Wakanda's de facto leaders, must find a way to set aside her sadness to confront the looming annihilation by advancing enemy forces. Most of the film shows how not only Shuri, but also Okoye (Danai Gurira) and Ramonda (Angela Bassett) all need to work together in order to prevent a major catastrophe from happening. I interpret this plot element as a metaphor for depression as a whole, since rising above intense emotional pain often requires the help of others. Because of that, this is a nice way of telling the audience that no matter how hard things may seem, there will always be others to aid them through their own personal difficulties.Due to the prevalent themes of loss and despair, this is the most melancholic film in the entire MCU library, even more so than the beginning of ""Avengers: Endgame"". Naturally this is a striking departure from the MCU we are all familiar with, which is usually light-hearted and fun for practically everybody. As a result, there are very few moments of comic relief to brighten the mood, and even then it does little to help alleviate the severity of a specific scene. If you are expecting the usual humorous situations that MCU fans have grown accustomed to after all these years or the characters constantly cracking jokes at a convenient time, you are going to be sorely disappointed.This film never wavers on its downbeat tone, with frequent reminders that the original hero is dead and not coming back. Of course, this is entirely understandable considering it would be disrespectful to not take into account Chadwick Boseman's monumental contribution to the series and the film plays along like something crucial is missing without him. Bearing that in mind, the film is still enjoyable in other ways. It does contain a number of good action scenes with some creative fight choreography and a deeper exploration of Wakandan lore to keep the audience invested. These are easily the most entertaining aspects of the film, as they remind us that Wakanda is more than simply the location where the Black Panther character originated. Just don't expect to be smiling too much during these highlights.Out of the three main actors whom the film chooses to focus on, I think Letitia Wright really shone the most as Shuri. Though we have seen Shuri do many important things in previous MCU films, I think it is here where we finally get to see her come into her own. Gone is the confident, meme-quoting sister of King T'Challa and in her place is a mournful, vulnerable young woman who misses her brother and just can't see herself taking his place as leader. Regardless of this shift in personality, Shuri still retains her intelligent side, which is featured much more extensively in this film than we've ever seen before. It's quite impressive to see how well Wright plays into Shuri's insecurities, never once exaggerating her emotions to the point of caricature or melodrama. Instead, she is shown to be a relatable human being, coming to terms with the sudden curveball life has thrown her.Though I must admit, none of this would have worked as well for Wright without the help of Angela Bassett and Danai Gurira as Ramonda and Okoye, respectively. As previously mentioned, they are all dealing with grief in their own unique ways but soon learn that working together to overcome it as a team is the best strategy. These characters feel like a real family, sticking together through what needs to be done to protect Wakanda from anything that threatens their existence. Even with the King no longer around to assist them, these three still prove themselves a formidable force against any hardship they may face.Given the unexpected turn of events surrounding the death of its main star, this film works surprisingly well with its remaining cast members and a more interesting look at Wakanda's place in the MCU. It's hard to say for certain how things may have turned out had Chadwick Boseman lived to reprise his role here, but if I had to guess I would assume we'd have gotten a more optimistic sequel without that feeling of loss hovering over every scene. Personally, I think they made the right decision not to recast and with all of that said, I am nonetheless convinced that Boseman would be pleased to see his legacy honoured in the best way possible under these circumstances. I know I would be.I rate it 8/10.",8/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"One of the most boring marvel movies to this day. Forgettable action scenes, poor dialogues, 5 year old humour. The graphics and cinematography are cool and well made and the music well fitting.

Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"""Wakanda Forever"" is MCU's 30-th movie and is phenomenal! The most powerful project of Phase 4. I can not understate how masterful the score is from start to finish. There are no weak links in the cast, but I have to give a special shoutout to Angela Basset and Letitia Wright's Shuri. Letitia is quite the beating heart of this film. And Tenoch Huerta? They couldn't have found a better Namor.""Ryan Coogler's emotional movies is about loss, legacy and healing. The story is intimate, but vast with global power struggles and palace intrigue. Tenoch Huerta's Namor is a force, better than I hoped. So much can be told...The scope, the camera work, the acting, and the raw emotions on and off screen can be felt throughout! Fantastic sequel and a great movie. I knew it'd be emotional and it was. Expect your eyes to leak.Immensely powerful story of forging forward-shattering at times, but also beautifully cathartic and heartening, still cannot get over how well the film earns that title.If Chadwick could see this movie, he'll be proud as much as I am right now!",8/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"At this point, Marvel is getting too saturated for its own good. The movie's beginning and the end is good, but the middle is too slow and crammed with corporate-mandated plot requirements, so much so that the writers didn't know what to do.I really feel that this is the product of unrealistic corporate deadlines, leading to incohesive and plot-hole ridden story, subpar CGI, and morally problematic characters that we are supposed to think are heroes. I don't think Marvel is really taking the time to quality check.To start, the villain is not really likeable or unlikeable. The villain just sort of exists. At least the first Black Panther movie had a villain that was likeable, carried by the performance of Michael B. Jordan. Another point of weakness is how Ironheart was crammed into the plot as required by Disney. As they tried to cram her in, plot points began to crack (which will not be mentioned here due to spoilers). The story is not cohesive. The third, and perhaps the biggest, point of weakness is the action scenes.Action scenes, you would think, would be the centerpieces of superhero movies, right? But Marvel's sweat-shop CGI studios seem to lack the motivation or at least the time to render quality products, not to mention how the choreography is sub-par as well. At the end, Black Panther 2's action scenes are forgettable.It is mildly entertaining enough to be an airplane or a steam-at-home movie, but this is by no means a great movie.",6/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"Depsite there being a few interesting aspects to this film, like a number of elements that seemed to have been borrowed from Ancient Greek mythology (namely the sirens and the winged feet), I have to admit that I found that this film was rather dull and boring. I guess one of the reasons was that Boseman's death seemed to be hanging over the entire film. Sure, one should pay tribute to him, but the problem is that I felt that it went just a little bit too far at times, and thus it really wasn't all that enjoyable.The film is basically about how the rest of the world have become rather annoyed at Wakunda because they aren't willing to share Vibranium with them, but they then discover some at the bottom of the ocean, using a machine that has been designed to detect vibranium. However, the rig is attacked and everybody on the rig is killed, and of course the people who are first accused is Wakunda. It turns out that they aren't the only ones who have access to vibranium, as the leader of a nation of undersea peoples approaches them and instructs them to find the scientist who invented the detector.Okay, ignoring the fact that a country who's economy is based on a single resource (and a resource that they don't even trade) is unlikely to become a world superpower (and of course they clearly don't want to interact with the rest of the world either), it does put things into perspective, particularly with regards to the United States. Unlike the previous film, there is more going on in the United States, and there is clearly some animosity towards Wakanda, namely because they aren't willing to play fair, at least play fair as far as the developed world is concerned.However, the main focus of the film seems to involve two empires who have vibranium coming into contact with each other, and the question iswho would win in the battle. This, mind you, results in there being a number of other plots that seem to not get resolved, or get resolved a bit too quickly, particularly the one involving the CIA agent who is eventually arrested because, well, he has got a bit too close to the Wakundans. Of course, we also have the ending, which is interesting, namely due to the suggestion that Wakunda may not actually be able to effectively integrate into the world at large.Still, in the end, I really found that this film was quite lacking, and rather boring. Some have suggested that Marvel can't do sequels, but I don't think that is the case because they have released some pretty good sequels. However, as for this one, I can't really place my finger on it, but it really didn't grab me all that much, and in part I really couldn't wait for it to end.",4/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"I want to start by saying I haven't been the biggest fan of this Phase 4 by Marvel that started with Black Widow in 2020, it's been hit & miss for me so I was nervous for the sequel to Black Panther. I'm happy to report that Black Panther: Wakanda Forever is a success. I think Ryan Coogler and his team hit a home run with Wakanda Forever by paying tribute to Chadwick Boseman and moving the story forward respectfully.I won't go into spoilers, but the movie starts with an emotional bang. Wakanda Forever builds on the great fondation that was established in the first Black Panther, a visual feast with breathtaking production design, fantastic costumes and impressive action sequences. The music from Ludwig Goransson is once again phenomenal, he creates a signature to this film that gives us the iconic sound of Wakanda while incorporing new themes for this sequel.Similar to the first film with Wakanda, there's a lot of world-building with the newly introduced Namor and the underwater world. This allows director Ryan Coogler to let his vision shine on the screen, it's spectacular to look at and the way they filmed the underwater sequences was truly astonishing. Ironically, most of superhero movies depend on their villains in order to succeed, they nailed it with Killmonger and what they did here is just as good, if not better.I don't think it's a perfect film, with a hefty runtime of 161 minutes, there are some moments that were dragging in the middle for me, but I think it was necessary for this film to be a bit longer than usual. Every character has their shining moments, Shuri is at the heart of this movie but Nakia, Okoye, M'Baku and Queen Ramonda all get their shining moments and a solid story arc that is rewarding by the end, so I don't really have an issue with the movie being this long.I have some other nitpicks that are spoiler-y, so I cannot really discuss them at the time. Everyone's motivation is clear and the main story is so engaging that I didn't really care for Marvel doing their usual ""laying the ground for the future"" stuff with certain characters (without getting into details). However, I can say that Namor was a terrific character, I absolutely love what they did with him storywise and visually. He absolutely slays during the action sequences, Tenoch Huerta is a great actor that fits the role perfectly, no surprise with the spot-on Marvel casting there.This is a movie to see on the big screen, without a doubt this is the best film the MCU has delivered in the Phase 4. The scale is epic but the film feels very intimate and personal because of what happened with Chadwick. The fact that they incorporated his passing into the story beautifully was so important & crucial. Ryan Coogler is probably the best director working for Marvel right now and I'm very excited to see what he does next after this big win.8/10.",8/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"I didn't have high expectations for this movie because of the mixed reviews, but it was actually decent. The plot was probably a Marvel formula plot, but I found it intriguing because it was interesting to see how Wakanda would cope after the death of the Black Panther. I liked the new characters especially the underwater species who made me doubt whether the Wakandans would beat them. I thought the action scenes were good especially the last fight scene which was pretty epic. I hope this is the last Black Panther movie because I think another movie would not turn out good and Marvel seem like they've run out of ideas.",7/10
Black Panther: Wakanda Forever (2022),"I enjoyed the Black Panther even though it was not all that great in the first place. This sequel was a hot mess. Wakanda is no longer even a semblance of a secret African country, just a location where black people are playing dress up in a movie. A lot of the storylines just fell flat. Some characters just appeared for 2 minutes and never heard of again.At times there was so much dialogue which did nothing to further the plot, where was the editing team? There are very few actors who can captivate the audience with their words none of those actors happened to be in this movie.The CGI was good and the action was pretty good. Its a Marvel superhero movie so I didn't expect much more than this. Black Panther was always a favorite comic book hero of mine and I am saddened that they could not do better for that legacy.",2/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"""Be kind, especially when you don't know what's going on.""If only we could recognize that those who combat us in life do so out of hidden pain, and fight them with kindness. If only we could accept our kids for who they are, and say supportive things from the heart instead of trying to mold them. If only we could be content with the life we have, and set aside the idea of the countless other lives we might have led, had we made different decisions along the way. If only we could see that the flipside to life being meaningless and everything ultimately being sucked into the abyss is the freedom that comes from that, that we can do anything with the time we've got.Like the first word in its title, this film feels like everything. While watching it I thought Stephanie Hsu was everything too, but then again, so was Michelle Yeoh and Jamie Lee Curtis. The homage to Wong Kar-Wai with Ke Huy Quan making his enlightened speech is extraordinary, and the fact that James Hong was still getting it done at age 93 was wonderful. I also loved how both mother and daughter, troubled as they were with their upbringing, each found comfort in a kind and patient partner, and Tallie Medel's character was a nice touch.The film threatens to go off the rails with its madcap multiverse hopping in the first part, but it's all a setup for the second part, which is incredibly powerful. It was impressive that it managed to be so entertaining along the way, with its fast-paced action and the wild ride it takes us on.

Anxieties, worries, mundane to-dos, even positive things, sometimes feel like they're swirling around in a chaotic funnel cloud and I would like nothing more than to sit in physical and mental silence.""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" felt like the inside of my head. In a world of non-stop, 24/7 news, most of it bad, how is a person like me, who has trouble filtering out things that affect me directly from all of the other things that are just out there happening in general and over which I have no control, supposed to cope?One answer is to decide that nothing matters anyway and give up caring. But that means deciding that my wife doesn't matter. And that my kids don't matter. And that art, and nature, and things that bring joy to my life, don't matter.Another way is to decide that some things, ok maybe most things, don't matter, but that there are things that do, and those are the things that make it all worth it. I get to decide what those things are.The first approach is nihilistic. The second approach is empowering. This film explores both approaches, and I was a sobbing mess at the end.I will say there were times that I was a bit exhausted by this movie. It throws a lot on the screen and at the viewer, and occasionally it can't keep up with its ambitions.

Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"It was my brother who recommended I watch this movie. He said it's crazy, but every time he thought to stop watching it, something else would happen to hold his attention. That wasn't quite my experience although I did stick with it to the end. I was also reminded of an almost identical experience some 20 years or so ago when a friend took me along with him to see a film he was raving about, ""Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon"" and that missed me by miles too when all that levitational martial-arts stuff started.Well, I couldn't get into ""Crouching..."" and I'm afraid it was the same for the sensory overload that was ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"". Go with the flow, sit back and let it happen is probably the best way to approach it but in the end, it was all too much for me.I sort of get the idea of multiple universes, where different versions of ourselves play out different destinies independent of what's actually happening to us in the here and now. Here though, the worlds are about to disastrously collide due to the emergence of an intergalactic super-criminal and it seems the first line of defence is Michelle Yeoh's unlikely middle-aged laundry owner Evelyn whose only concern when we first meet her is to get an almost unrecognisable Jamie-Lee Curtis's hulking auditor to sign off on the business's annual accounts and so keep her in business. Her dull husband then takes this moment to reveal that he's an alternative version of himself from what he calls the Alphaverse and that they are about to have the fight of their lives to try to thwart the approaching big bad super-villain whose identity I'll hold back from revealing.And that's your condensed plot. There are lots of characters straddling the universes you'd barely noticed earlier who suddenly drop back in and out of what I'll loosely call the narrative. Just when you think you've got a reasonable grip of one plot strand, it completely unravels and takes you in another direction.I certainly saw things I've never seen before or ever will again in a movie, including characters with hot-dog hands, a bagel as the centre of human knowledge, two inanimate rocks sharing a conversation and then there are the spoofs drawn from original features like ""2001"" and ""Ratatouille"" two films I didn't think I'd ever bracket in the same sentence.I also found the several attempts at humour to often be way too crude and vulgar for my taste, especially when you get two of the villains looking to boost their powers by sticking a sharp object up their behinds or another baddie getting knocked about by a set of male genitalia.Good luck to you if you managed to comprehend and actually enjoy this movie, but in the end I'm afraid it overpowered me into resistance. Maybe it was just some giant spoof of all those superhero blockbusters which have obsessed Hollywood for years. I don't know, but despite its successful box-office and the ratings here, I sort of wish that for two hours at least, I'd woken up in an alternative universe where I actually hadn't watched it at all.",3/10

Could things have turned out differently for Evelyn, maybe in a parallel universe?The plot summary for this movie intrigued me immensely: the idea of exploring how things might work out if you'd plotted a different course or, more broadly, the idea of parallel realities. The actual product, however, is far less engaging or coherent.The lack of engagement begins immediately. The Wangs' everyday life is a manic, unfocussed existence and just following this for the first 20 minutes or so was fairly annoying. It doesn't get any better once the multiverse concept is introduced, this just being an excuse for random detours and well-choreographed but meaningless action scenes.It's like a typical pretentious concept-driven sci fi/fantasy movie: paper over the lack of plot with a concept and developments that are so radical and in-your-face that viewers are fooled into thinking there's something clever there, when there isn't. Then, to make it seem even more important, have the movie go for 140 minutes when 100 minutes would have been sufficient.Every now and again there is a profound moment but due to the preceding scenes being all empty random action there's no context and the impact is diluted.Disappointing.",4/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"I watch and re-watch a lot of movies per year as a hobby (no money involved), and today I have 9988 reviews in IMDb. Last month, I received an email from IMDb listing ""Everything Everywhere All at Once"" as one of the Top-10 movies of 2022. In IMDb, it is informed that this flick is nominated for 10 BAFTA Awards, 240 wins and 351 nominations. I can only understand that this is a heard behavior to the promotion of studio, using ""professional critics"" and press to promote such a garbage. I cannot envision a normal being, without financial interest or being manipulated by critics, to enjoy this crap. It seems to be a bad trip of the writers turned into a movie by insane productors. In the end, this film is 2h 19 min of complete waste of time. My vote is one (awful).Title (Brail): ""Tudo em Todo Lugar ao Mesmo Tempo"" (""Everything Everywhere All at Once"")",1/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"Visual Orgy of Visual Metaphors That Get Old Well Before Film Ends. So disappointing, and the film doesn't live up to the hype. First half has some engaging moments, where it could have wrapped up without ""explaining"" what we already knew. I don't need a primer to explain the content and themes of a film thank you very much.Could of been so much better, but film fails to rely upon the intricate visuals so painstakingly laid out, deciding we needed explanation of the filmmakers' intent instead. Such a hedge essentially ruined this film - it is awkward and runs about 45 minutes too long. Nice effort visually - my rating id higher than I feel it should be, but the visuals were often witty, so...5.Overall, I had to force myself to see entire film, and it was painful. I feel cheated out of ""what could have been."" Perhaps one Director would have made a difference. Don't know. Won't ever know. It's a self-indulgent mess. 💣",5/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"Well, where to start? I'm going to try to be fair with my review but quite honestly, it's going to be difficult not to be flippant. The film is currently a Top 250 IMDb picture with an 8.2 rating, and rarely do I stray too far from the generally considered opinion, but this was just a chore to sit through. Not only that, but if you fell asleep for any length of time before it was over it wouldn't have made any difference at all, you wouldn't have missed a beat. In fact, the first time I saw 'The End' pop up on screen, it would have been okay with me.What I can say perhaps in defense of the film is that it truly lives up to its name because it does try to be everything, everywhere, all at once. For me, not a good thing. It was as if you took any number of random ideas and concepts and threw them into a blender to see what came out. For example, green eggs and ham, Topo Gigio, e=mc squared, pineapple pizza, and squirrel nut zippers. See how easy it is? I can't tell you how many times I said to myself, 'Please God, let this be over'.I guess I'd have to give credit to the film makers at least for an ambitious editing job with the picture's all too frequent scene changes and skip jumps from one thing to another. But I can't help but feel that the sentimental ending was supposed to help you forget what you just went through. And oddly enough, I was able to follow the main story line well enough, but it took forever to make its point, which if I had to summarize, would be:Be kind - even if my review isn't.",4/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"This one is a meh film, someone's alternate idea of multi-verse sci-fi and ""how do we script things to get Michelle Yeoh doing martial arts again"" ? A long, long way to push a theme about LGBT acceptance. The anal plugs and dildos were just odd and a strange inclusion. Some of the characters were outright annoying such as the daughter and the various minions. The hubby was OK as he smoothly switched personalities. Good old James Hong still with us, always recall him as ""hey that guy..."". Jamie Lee Curtis is fine as the IRS Auditor hamming it up. And Yeoh going through the paces, looks like a bit of a payday for her. All in all certainly not one of the better films of the year.",5/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"Everything Everywhere All At Once is even crazier than the trailer would lead one to believe. It's bursting with so many original, weird concepts and ideas that no serious storyteller in their right mind would ever dare to put in their movie. But Daniels did. And it works with spectacularly effective results.These filmmakers choose not only to put every bizarre idea they could think of into their movie, but they ensure that every oddity adds something to the thought-provoking, emotionally resonant themes that pervade the story. So many angles can be explored surrounding this story of emotional connection and the things that distract from it.As Evelyn connects with her alternate selves and alternate relatives, there is both envy of and pity toward them that is explored. It's such a cathartic experience to watch this woman discover what she truly wants from life and loves about her life.All of the beautiful themes and heartwarming character moments are just the tip of the iceberg here, though. This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.The Daniels lean into the absurdity of the world that they have created, always reaching for the most outlandish possibilities and never playing it safe. It makes for some truly outstanding visual gags that will never leave my mind., and it makes for the most unique viewing experience I have ever had in my life.This is a masterpiece of originality. There is not, nor will there ever be, a film quite like this one. And I cannot wait to watch it again and again and again.",10/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"In what universe is a film starring Jamie Lee Curtis with hotdogs for fingers considered Oscar-worthy? The answer to that question seems to be 'this one', Everything Everywhere All At Once having been nominated in eleven categories at the 2023 Academy Awards. I'm beginning to wonder if I've somehow slipped into an alternate reality where a film's worth is measured by how quirky, irritating and baffling it is.I believe that this film's success is down to viewers not wanting to admit that they don't 'get' it - ""It's A24, and that means it's intellectual, and if I say I don't understand it everyone will think I am stupid"". Well I think you're stupid for playing along.So what's the film about? Well, Michelle Yeoh plays laundromat owner Evelyn Wang, who discovers that the universe is made up of infinite parallel realities, each one different, and that an evil force is attempting to... ah, who am I kidding? I can't sum up this film. I tried to follow the plot, but there's so much random crap crammed into the excruciatingly tedious 139 minutes, all edited so as to induce a migraine, that I soon found myself struggling, not just to understand the plot, but to stay watching till the end.I get that the film is attempting to say something profound about life -- being happy with the choices that we have made, having no regrets, and accepting others for who they are -- but it's hard to give a toss about any of that when faced with such relentless codswallop.Rant over, I'm off to try and find a universe where this film doesn't exist.",1/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),I get the movie but why is it every time a strange movie gets high ratings.. I think it's because most people don't understand it yet they don't want to look stupid by saying they don't. Watch the movie when it's free but don't waste $20 to see it or you'll be deeply disappointed.,6/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"This was a long and unnecessarily complex film to get you the message that life and people are messy and you should accept them for who they are. I would have preferred a more straightforward story telling and I could have done without all of the body humor...putting things forcibly in one's anus, ball gag humor, hot dog fingers, eating buggers, etc. I didn't even find that type of humor amusing as a child.The only scene I even remotely enjoyed in this film was the straightforward scene towards the end of the film when Evelyn and Waymond are not together and he explains that he knows she thinks he is weak, but he is fighting in a different way, with kindness. That short but sweet moment is in my opinion, the only redeeming aspect of this film.I have heard some reviewers rave about how this was like the best acid trip...I can't comment on that since I have never done acid and I have no intention of ever trying it, especially since as a healthcare worker I know and understand the very real dangers of doing acid. I will say that I do not watch films to experience an acid trip, I watch films to be entertained and preferably with a good story.This story essentially boils down to a struggling small business owner (laundromat), is being audited by the IRS, not having a good relationship with her husband who has decided to ask for a divorce hoping to just get her to talk about their marriage, and she has a struggling gay daughter who she is avoiding telling her father who didn't accept her marital decision about. Suddenly ta-da, she discovers that there are all these other universes that are populated with other versions of her that made different choices...like didn't marry her husband and didn't move to America. Also, she is the only person uniquely qualified to save this multiverse by tapping into skills from other universes versions. And she is saving it from the big bad who turns out to be her daughter who she created....and her ""everything bagel"".I'd say it was ridiculous, but not once did I laugh and I kind of agree with the viewers who said when they saw ""the end"" on the screen for the first time that would have been happy if that was truly the end.I am sorry. I love both Michelle Yeoh AND Jamie Lee Curtis and would really like to support films anchored by strong female characters...but this film isn't one I can get behind. (Although the message, about being kind and accepting...l am 100% behind! If you can choose to do one thing, be kind is my motto.) Along that line, I think it would be kind to recommend a different film with a ""be kind"" message...how about ""It's a Wonderful Life"".",1/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"This maybe the worst movie experience I've had in a theatre in long long time. I really can't remember the last time I watched a movie until the end and feeling utterly dejected without walking out--the closest is one of the more recent superhero movies (Avengers). Both titles have received high praise both from critics as well as audiences--but I did not connect with either of them. Clearly I am not the target-audience--I have little patience for films that claim to be ""smart"" by the sheer amount of confusion they cause--but a movie hailed by many as ""nearly perfect"" is hardly watchable.For most of the first 30 min, I felt assaulted by the sheer barrage of sounds and visuals which made very little coherent sense. I was wrong. In the next two hours, the film showed me I was an idiot--the first 30 min was the better part actually. As the movie went on, my sense of assault and confusion only increased. I constantly asked myself, ""when would this end?""",1/10

Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"If you take drugs for the first time and imagined Jackie Chan was a female Dr. Strange in another universe this would be it. And the synopsis is basically an Asian woman trying to do her taxes. I thought the third act of the movie felt a little stretched out but otherwise I think it's the best movie I've seen all year because I haven't laughed this much in any recent one. From the short time I spent in China, it's also an accurate and hilarious view of Chinese parents 'cause they really do be like that. I can't recommend it enough, it's so chaotic and in the middle of all that managed to be heartfelt too. I thought it was gonna be a Dr Strange wannabe but it's unique on it's own and I'm glad it was released earlier so that people don't compare them. It was just four people (strangers) in the cinema, we were laughing our asses off and it made me sad because everyone deserves to see this. At a time when remakes and reboots are common place it's nice to have something like this, a breath of fresh air.",9/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"Not the popular opinion, but this one is another disappointing multiverse outing.Unlike Dr. Strange: Multiverse of Madness, this one received overwhelming positive reviews which was the very reason for me giving this movie my time. But it turned out to be a dud. It took me to the verge of giving up after the first hour, and thought it might get better but alas not. Performance wise cheers for Michelle Yeoh and Ke Huy Quan. Other than that, it's silly and takes you on a skippable acid trip.Bottom line: Definitely not worth the hype. Watch it without any expectations and you just might like it.Watch it on Amazon Prime Video.",5/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"This film almost unanimously received praise from both critics and audience alike. People even exaggeratedly rank it as one of the greatest films ever or the best they've ever seen. Going into this movie, my expectations were really high And I really wanted to be part of the majority who loves this movie. But unfortunately the opposite happened and I didnt like it. While I appreciate that this movie was made on a relatively small budget and managed to get some things right as it had so much potential with its strong female lead, philosophical component and some good action to move it along. But it fell really short. It is long and meandering. Visually confusing, thematically unoriginal. The first half was repetitive, boring and also quite silly. Half of the time I don't know what are they fighting for or what the heck is going on. And what was supposed to be the multiverse just felt like the characters were wearing silly different costumes. It is not until the last act that things of relevance happened. The performance from the cast was great though.",6/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"Most of us who are mindful of the film can agree on one thing, Everything Everywhere All at Once feels like you're walking on an acid trip experience. It's an imaginary film that makes you feel like you had just swallowed a bottle of limitless pills, dopes, drugs or other substances that may similarly affect your consciousness and memories.And this movie deliversssssssssss that! Wow wow wow! Imagine if Dr Strange, Limitless, The Matrix, Click, Rick & Morty, Star Wars, Ratatouille and Manchester By the Sea combined to become a film, Everything Everywhere All at Once is the one! Now you must be wondering, how could Ratatouille and The Matrix complement each other to be in the same movie? 🤣🤣🤣 This question should be THE reason you should go support this film now in cinemas!Produced by A24, an independent film company, I was surprised at how they have pulled this off. Half of the film is located at an office, which is understandable considering A24 produces low or semi-budget films. But it's such a wonder how this movie could be so good with only so few places the movie took place for the first hour. What's even better is EEAAO occurred within closed and overcrowded spaces that may slightly trigger people experiencing ADHD, hypersensitivity and claustrophobia, pushing the film into maximum impact.This film is filled with action-packed sequences that will blow you brains out! It's fun, exhilarating, creative, hilarious and never-been-done-before! Adding up with the out-of-the-world concept and unique storyline, every fighting scene seems appropriately done and even if there's just so many styles and tones of scenes coming out from the screen, fitting is the right word to describe them.EEAAO seems like any other movie at the beginning but when all hell breaks loose, the story becomes increasingly complex as it explains the world revolving around the central character, propelling the plot into motion. Meticulously explained, the narrative manages to be exciting and outrageously wild but reasonable within its own multiverse contexts.Michelle Yeoh, our Malaysian actress 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻, is excellent in this, proving that she's fluid in bringing out the best of her multiple character(s). Complicated as it is, she knew what kind of project she's doing and it just shows how dedicated she is at acting. It's not easy to play her role and it's definitely not easy to create multiple personas interconnected by different universes and dimensions, with separate storylines, all destined to have the same fate. This is an Oscar-worthy performance, and whether or not if Yeoh got nominated lies on the decision if the Oscar recognizes speculative fiction as a genre acceptable to compete with other highly-appraisal films.There were many genuinely laugh-out-loud moments throughout, NOT the one where you're forced to laugh just because everyone is laughing to avoid the awkwardness surrounding the audience in the hall, but the one that it's just funny you're having a truly good time. The script and performance help to amplify the comedic moment but the most special thing is that it's aware of its VFX effects and the team knows how to level up/down the intensity and realness of the CGI. How so? The CGI is very good, but there are times that the CGI is made to be purposely bad, like you're watching a short film by a bunch of ambitious varsity students, and it works! It works because everyone in the theater was laughing, it clicks just right with the moments and scenes you're watching. You'll laugh at how bad it is in a good way!If there's one dislike from this film is that it's gonna be a tough watch for some people. Like mentioned earlier, those with ADHD and hypersensitivity may be triggered with the intensity of this film. Also, the storyline is difficult for some to digest due to its complexity of its universe-building. The film is promoted as being light and fun but...EEAAO is weighty, dark, bizarre and surreal, only those who have what it takes can appropriately understand the building block storytelling.Verdict: Mind-bending and mind-blowing, Everything Everywhere All at Once masters its building block storytelling that feels like an acid trip worth experiencing and that experience... can only be felt once in a lifetime. We're only in March but without a doubt, this is already the best film of the year! Sorry, summer blockbuster movies!",9/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"It was everything everywhere all at once. Sometimes too many things, too many places at once and you can get lost, but it helps to focus on things.Obviously, the amazing Michelle Yeoh is one thing to focus on. The whole reason I myself came to see this flick in the first place. Much as this movie gives you to absorb it was easy to keep my eyes on the beautiful Yeoh.Oh, and the kid from Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom is in this flick. He's older odiously but he still sounds like the kid form The Goonies. How lucky he was he got to play Yeoh's baby daddy in this joint.Last and definitely not least it was good to see James Wong in this film. You could tell they most likely made some filming adjustments to assure the 90 something year old actor can do the role but that's what you do when you have legends do your flick.Speaking of legends, almost forgot about Jamie lee Curtis who seem like she was having fun in her role.The fact that this movie is about a multiverse I low key was expecting a multiverse connection between who Yeoh plays in this movie, and her character in Shang shi. That would have been cool.It's interesting that this like the third movie that came out in March that's about the mommy daughter relationship between Asian women. What's even more interesting is how they go in order. Turning Red is about a 13-year-old and Her mom, Umma is about an 18-year-old and her mom and the girl playing Yeoh's daughter looks like she's possibly in her early 20s. Don't know when this became a hot plot in movies, but I will admit I prefer how the story lays out here (but only because I relate more to an Asian woman in her 20s over a middle schooler)The music in this film is great. The movie was filmed in the context that the story is about a laundromat owner in her mid-life dealing with where she came from and where she's going, but the music actually fits perfectly into the ideal of this woman being the key to saving the multiverse and it made for a lot of the entertainment. Just these big orchestra cues that make it sound like I'm watching Dune contradicting, the image of Yeoh being a worn-out blue-collar mom. Spectacular!I say it's good. It's all over the place and it can be a handle to process, but it has a good cast to concentrate on.",9/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"All the other reviewers have said it.Dialogue: superficial, pretentious, ludicrous, trying to sound wise and philosophical but failing miserably.Acting: ok but sometimes felt like a lot of mindless reading of lousy dialogue (see above).Comedy: childish and doesn't make any sense 90% of the time.Story: going around in circles and getting nowhere. More plot holes than a sieve.Premise: done and done and over done. Some say take it lightly, but how can we when they are so serious about relationships and quantum mechanics and the universe, while in the next breath they don't seem to understand how evolution works or how sausages are made. Like I say, poppycock.A friend of mine said it has a nice message about mental health and depression. What a very subtle way to tell a story. Give the director an Oscar for most lurid movie ever. If this was a cartoon or anime or whatever you wanna call it, I'd give it a 4 for effort. But as it is, it doesn't deserve more than 2 stars.",1/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"It's been a long time since i felt this way watching a film and wanting it just to end, This is a perfect example of how a good idea can turn into a waste.

Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"Rarely does a movie hit me hard and I go along for the ride. Every moment has a spectacle to it. Even the simplicity of having your taxes done. Often silly, mostly confusing but entirely entertaining. It was great to see Short Round back on the big screen with a very glamoured down Michelle Yeoh as a married couple on the brink of fracturing a family unit.The story is of, Evelyn, a woman who has never really committed to much in life. She has many interest but many where she isn't fully invested in. In this case, her family lives above the laundromat that is failing. They are being audited, but yet she has big dreams to expand her enterprise. Her husband (the fore mentioned Ke Huy Quan) Waymond, is a kindly follower and believer of his wife who seems to focus more on the bad than the good. Pessimist, if we are to be formal. It is the Chinese New Year, and many people are invited to celebrate with this family, including a Grand-Father who is labeled as a man set in his ways and wouldn't understand the same-sex relationship of his grandaughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). What follows is a grand adventure, first at the IRS building (of all places) and eventually to distant alternate universes to which shows her the way her life may have gone had certain things didn't take place. I absolutely loved the fact that Jamie Lee Curtis plays the uptight auditor, who seems perfectly fine in the core universe to which all revolve around. Evelyn, on the other hand, taps into her other universes to gather the skills needed to fight a fracture in the timelines that sneak into her mundane life.Yes, there is a message here. And...to be honest, it nearly derails the film itself. But it was required to tie in the meaning of everything that is going on. That we are made of experiences of every universe that exists out there (if you believe in metaphysics) and that they road you didn't take, through gained experiences, with some that even was more enticing then the present one, means we would never have known our other lives. Children wouldn't be born, love would be lost, relationships move on. It is the grand question of whether or not if we got a glimpse of that road we didn't take, would it all mean anything. In this case, I say it almost derails because the universes effect one another. And in this story, it even bridges them. Which to some, may feel like a cheat. However, the fact that I even ask this question makes it a vastly interesting story. That is for you to decide.The movie is exciting, vibrant, energetic and feels absolutely unique. It allows the viewer to slowly tie the ends together, and perhaps sometimes gets too far ahead. But doesn't let you lose yourself too much. What it isn't is boring. It is captivating and fresh. And, look, who can hate a scene of people being beaten with rubber phalluses?That said, it is one of the most interesting movies of 2022 and hopefully stays in the minds of awards in the future. Because it deserves a bigger audience. These are the types of fun, philosophical questions buoyed by comedy that we need.I go back to Ke Huy Quan. This guy can do funny and also bring a tug to your heart so easily. It's so hard to imagine him as the little boy from ""Indiana Jones And The Temple Of Doom"" because, here he shows so much range. His natural charm is shown through his love for Evelyn. He seems to be suffering through a fracture himself. He plays many roles here as well. Because, in many universes in life, the theory here may be that we will run into people we are meant to run into regardless of choices. That's a very romanticized view on the universe.Kudos to The Daniels for their talent and joy of cinema. It would not surprise me if they helm a larger film in the future. Perhaps they can re-vamp a comic book franchise into something much more unique.Thank you for this movie.",9/10
Everything Everywhere All at Once (2022),"First of all if you have seen this film and loved it I am sorry. I'm not dissing you, everyone has their fave things. And I'm sure some found this to be a great film.However, I tried 3 times to watch it before I finally understood what was going on. Once I did, I realised why it had taken 3 times. Basically, it's a crap film.Let me explain why it's crap.Firstly you have no clue what's coming but a couple of middle aged Chinese taking their laundry receipts to the IRS to face a bulldoggish middle aged woman who makes uninteresting speeches about their receipts is NOT interesting. Neither is the fast talk in the elevator which still does not really explain anything and I found it to be confusing.Then what is all that about a divorce? Are they divorcing? Why? What has this to do with the film?Then suddenly the security come and her husband turns into a King Fu killer taking them all down with a scarf, before IRS lady staples something (unknown) to her head and attacks them. All the while phone earpieces that glow green are chucked about and laundry woman goes is seemingly magically transported from place to place, talking about her dog and her IRS bill and her divorce.Utter, rubbish. Pure and perfect trash. I was actually irritable at not being able to see what everyone is banging on about. It's not a great film, it's an awful one. I'm sure it will end up a cult film as the worst films usually do.Please do not waste any of your life on it like I did.",2/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"All Quite on the Western Front is depressing, tense, moving and a frustrating reminder of how useless war is. The cinematography, performances, battle sequences sound design are all top notch. I do feel as if the movie became a little too scattered before the big battle halfway through the movie, and could have done a better job developing characters. It's a minor complaint but you will feel the runtime of the movie during certain points.One scene that will stay with me for a long time was the sequence in the crater. I was a complete and utter mess during that whole sequence. Seeing Paul gain his humanity back for the fallen soldier absolutely broke me.All Quite on the Western front may not saying anything new about war, but it's a relevant-sobering reminder of the futility of war. One that will stay with you long after the credits roll.",8/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"This is not strictly-speaking an adaption of Erich Maria Remarque's classic. A few minor incidents from the novel are included, but Remarque's biggest contribution to this film is the title. Given the ending of the film (as opposed to the book) the title is somewhat misleading, but it's such a classic that the film-makers' decision is quite understandable.This is a brutal and uncompromising study of the realities of war. The fact the the war depicted took place more than a hundred years ago doesn't make it any less relevant. It could be shown in Ukraine today, and soldiers on both sides would understand.Nor is the film's anti-war message terribly new. It is, however, a message that needs to be repeated over and over again, until (maybe) enough people take it seriously.The battle scenes are appallingly visceral - possibly the best of their type since the opening of Saving Private Ryan.The history of any war is written by the winners, but that doesn't stop them being a tragedy for the poor grunts on the losing side as well.",9/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"This movie did something I didn't expect from a World War movie...it makes you feel empathetic for the Germans. To an extent.I'm no war buff so I'll leave the realism to the experts but what this movie does is show you the first World War from the view point of people who've never experienced or even conceived of war and bloodshed on this scale. It starts off with new recruits full of patriotism for their country expecting to be sent on a grand adventure only to have those expectations quickly shattered. Turns out war isn't fun, and not even initially due to the actual fighting. Just training and constantly being screamed at and controlled while marching your days away is brutal. Remember, while vehicles existed, they weren't common use at this period of time...these soldiers had to walk, walk, and walk some more to get to where the war effort was taking place. And even if they had vehicles most of those places didn't have roads yet to drive them on. Then there's the constant lack of food and water, rough sleeping conditions, being exposed to the elements. Just GETTING to the war is brutal. That's a good 3rd of the movie right there.Then close to the half way point, after a few minor skirmishes, we see the war front and the trenches and get to see what that's like. Well...it's terrible! You pop up out of a trench and boom...you're shot. And that's just life in between charges. There was no strategy to the charges either, they relied on waves of bodies to gain even 100 meters, hoping to out pace the bullets constantly coming your way. Millions of young men died in this fashion, their bodies littering the field.The most brutal part of the film is the weapons of war never before seen. Tanks, flame throwers, planes dropping bombs. Men screaming in pure terror while the bullet proof tanks drive over them, while flames fill their trenches, or planes blow them up while they flee.And the odd thing is since we're seeing it from the eyes of the young German soldiers, who are truly clueless as to why they're really even fighting, you do empathize and feel sorry for them. You find yourself even rooting for them. This movie humanizes them but importantly shows the politicians who are truly to blame for the atrocities. The powerful men behind the scenes, bloated from being overfed on rich foods, hundreds of miles away from the pain and suffering they cause.I have no idea how accurate this movie is but it's a pretty straight forward piece showing just how awful, terrifying, and destructive this period of time was. I really enjoyed it and recommend it to any fans of this genre.",8/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"Germany, May 1917. 17-year-old Paul Baumer enthusiastically enlists in the German army and heads off to war. His head is filled with patriotism, honour, visions of heroism and the confidence that Germany will win the war. He soon learns that his impressions of war are far from the reality.Erich Maria Remarque's ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" was first published in 1929. It was quite revolutionary, depicting the horrific reality of war rather than the glamourous, sanitised version. In a sense it was the first anti-war novel. It was so unflinching in its portrayal of WW1 that the Nazi party regarded it as treasonous and had the book banned and stripped Remarque of his German citizenship, causing him to flee to Switzerland and ultimately the US.In 1930 Hollywood made the book into a movie. It was superb, capturing well the horrors that Remarque depicted in his book. It deservedly won the Oscar for Best Picture (and Best Director) in 1930.In 1979 it was adapted again, this time as a made-for-TV movie. Despite being directed by Delbert Mann and boasting a star-studded cast (Richard Thomas, Ernest Borgnine, Ian Holm, Donald Pleasance) this version was far from being in the same league as the 1930 version and didn't do the book justice. It is quite tame and the performances are quite subdued.This, the 2022 version, once again captures the essence of the book and is quite unflinching in its portrayal of war. Graphic scenes and realistic plot show the wastefulness and horror of war.Not as good as the 1930 version though: the characters aren't as fully developed, limiting engagement, and the plot feels a bit padded. A few drawn out scenes could easily have been shorter without losing any detail. Some style-over-substance elements too as the director went overboard with the special effects he had at his disposal (the French counter-attack with tanks and flamethrowers is a good example). The droning sound didn't help either (clearly the director has watched Christopher Nolan's ""Dunkirk"").",8/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"I'm really a Film Nerd and I've watched many famous and less famous war movies, too. Until this Evening, the beach-sequene and the final of Saving Private Ryan was one of the most intense experiences I've seen on the big screen.But what Berger and his teams show here is still incredible & and the most horryfying depiction of war I've ever seen before.The violence makes you feel sick, there were really some moments I thought I have to leave the cinema. Shooting, Explosions, blood, cold, wetness, Tanks, flamethrowers and inhuman suffering. Meaningless suffering.Yes, theire are some flaws in the Story, but Overall it works out fine. Music, acting and production design are phenomenal!But the violience, I still can't believe it. Go watch - afterwards you'll definetley be pacifist.8/10.",9/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"I'm truly conflicted: ""All Quiet on The Western Front"" is a surprisingly stark & cold film upon first watch, capturing the futility of war, loss of youth & corruption of innocence with an unsettling lack of emotion throughout.It's something I couldn't help but notice as I tuned in; usually in historical war films (like Sam Mendes' ""1917"" for instance, following events through the eyes of the opposing British side), we're accustomed to typically witnessing soldier's actions depicted as valiant & honourable, with a palpable sense of pride & patriotism embedded throughout - in pieces which are made to catalogue their innumerable brave achievements conducted by every-day folk (who, through no fault of their own, found themselves in the trenches), in spite of insurmountable odds comprehensively stacked against them... But here, there's no dignity in anything that transpires; obstacles aren't admirably overcome, the ensemble don't conduct themselves in a way which is befitting of their station, worthy of respect & none of the characters win any semblance of what could honestly be described as ""glory""... They're just young, impressionable fools - drunk on propaganda - who have mindlessly partaken in the unwarranted military occupation of foreign land, where they are obviously not welcome by the inhabitants. Due to this, there's a void of relatability & moreover, all the team of participants can dream of - once they arrive at the front - or endeavour to guarantee for themselves is survival, not greatness.However, despite this inability to sympathise being an irksome grievance of mine, in the production's defense, I suppose that's actually intentional & rather the whole point (?), since it's meant to tell the story through the perspective of the vanquished, not the conquerors, reflecting how naive recruits (who'd been fatally misled, in conscripting themselves & their families in the first place) were gradually numbed to their feelings by the constant mental & physical anguish inflicted upon them in a continuous onslaught of pointless offensives (instigated by their generals), once reality had firmly bitten & they'd been collectively disabused of this fantasy - but unfortunately, that noticeable detachment from any of the characters featured results in a somewhat muted response (as a viewer) when they're incessantly chewed up & spat out by the gratuitous violence - that's shot in a hauntingly raw, ominous way - they're repeatedly (& needlessly) thrust in to by the callous, cowardly officers, who arrogantly orchestrate the entire miserable situation that needn't last a single day longer.Again, I suppose that only reaffirms the statement the creators are trying to make, wilfully juxtaposing intense sequences of suffering & pain with little sentimentality & ambivalence; the film chronicles how Germany treated (or more accurately, mistreated) its own people, offering up generations of its future citizens on the battlefield as sacrificial lambs, massacred at the altar of a poisonous, nationalistic ideology which had taken root within the governing population; boys - barely men, even some who weren't yet - were essentially reduced to nothing but disposable, unimportant objects, thoughtlessly discarded & simply replaced in a sadistic game & quest for absolute power (no matter the personal cost or price paid in blood) - an incalculable loss which (even by the time the armistice came in to effect) still wasn't enough to satiate the tyrannical desires of the few, controlling the many... And the movie does therefore (to its credit) accurately reflect that exact point in its portrayal of the poor cannon fodder by representing them as exactly that, & additionally lenses the apathy of the superiors (who give the indefensible orders) through a perspective of rightful, scornful contempt.Hence, I can understand the creative intentions (depicting the utter, irredeemable meaninglessness; the wanton, senseless destruction) & the grim inhumanity of it all... Yet after seeing such horrors & heinous cruelties, I guess I felt like I wanted a purpose to everything I'd sat through by the time the credits started rolling - & thought I'd been cheated by the fact that there wasn't one. On the other hand, like I acknowledge earlier, I assume that's not accidental - & rather the understandably cynical, bitter & despondent conclusion the narrative decidedly wants the audience to come to by the time it reaches its unsatisfactory denouement; there is no discernible reason that could ever hope to justify the carnage we observe - the savagery that unfolds is simply slaughter for the sheer sake of it & the trauma experienced by all those affected was utterly preventable, had the invaders put aside their vanity & pride & sought to preserve peace which could've so effortlessly been maintained.Plus, it does also show one massive miscalculation on the side of the victors; forcing the Germans in to reluctant submission & backing them in to signing an agreement with terms they couldn't accept would ultimately entrench resentful animosity that would act as a spark to light the fire of the 2nd World War, only a few decades later etc. Foreshadowing what was to come before anyone could predict the oncoming calamity. Due to this, irrespective of what I think (or more aptly, how little it evoked within me), I must concede that it remains a success, regardless - because the project undoubtedly achieved its goal in a commendably brutal & unflinching manner - & I can't plausibly surmise any alternative which would've resulted in something better.",9/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"I've just came out of the TIFF presentation of this film. Before going in, I assumed that little could be done with the story and the presentation would be one of cinematic sequences and sound. I wasn't wrong, and boy was I blown away (excuse the terrible pun).After leaving the theatre, I'd say that it was more an experience than a film, one that at time I found difficult to witness. Not for the faint of heart, this isn't a film that'll be easy to forget.Not having read the book but having seen its two predecessors, it's easy to get engulfed in the production and feel like you're seeing this story for the first time.",10/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"In the excellent 1930s original, war is seldom better summarised than by: 'It's dirty and painful to die for your country, when it comes to dying for your country it's better not to die at all. There are millions out there dying for their countries, and what good does it do?'.It's a statement that applies just as well today, and complimented by this outstanding piece of film making too, which leaves us under no illusions of man's inhumanity to man. The performances are truly incredible, the technical achievement recreating scenes of war outstanding, and the messages as clear as any about the futility of armed combat and the inability of the human race to learn its lessons - even to this day. Not really a film to enjoy, but certainly a film to reflect on how far we haven't come since 1918, especially in a world that often seems so intent on pulling itself apart.",9/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"A fascinating film with potential that was never fully achieved. ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" does not rely solely on shock value to disturb its audience; instead, it uses the horrors of war to sober them with facts and dismal realities. The film's story was worth telling; it left an impression long after the credits rolled. It dealt with many weighty themes, including a young man's journey through war, the difficulties of combat, the cruelty of desperation, and the value of friendship and camaraderie, all of which were handled with grace and artistry. Furthermore, it boasted first-rate production values, breathtaking visuals, a terrific score (although maybe a tad bit over the top), and stellar acting. Although there is much to praise about the film, ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" is ultimately hampered by its drawn-out length, the plot dragging in spots, and several confusing moments. All the pieces were in place for ""All Quiet on the Western Front"" to be the best picture of the year, and in some respects, it is. Fans of the genre, or anyone who appreciates a well-made film, should not miss this film despite its limitations.Rating: 7.5/10 (Impressive)",7/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"Never expected a netflix movie to shake me to my core but this film kept me frozen in my seat even after a few minutes into the ending credits. It made me think about war and what it does to people. Just as the book had done. But this time due to the superb acting, marvelous cinematography and flawless direction that feeling will stay with me for a long time. They took a great desicion by using an all German cast which made it feel ever more real. And the way they made me feel connected to the charecters. I mourned each one of them and kept praying for the movie to be war soon ,so they could get a happy ending.",8/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"I watched this film today in Berlin and my god, I couldn't find a fault with it. The cinematography, the acting, the set, and the portrayal of the brutality of war was all just perfect. There is no glorification, it's tragic, but it feels true. The original author of the book based it on his personal experience in the trenches, which certainly came through in the movie.This is a film that should be viewed by anybody thinking of joining the army and it couldn't have been released at a better time, given that there is another war in Europe. I really hope Netflix gives it Russian subtitles and makes it free for Russian-speaking audiences, because I don't think I've come across a war movie that is more anti-war than this. There is a reason why the book was banned in Nazi Germany.This film absolutely deserves ten stars.",10/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"Great performance, slow paced but with full of meanings and dramatical moments during the First World War. I saw more the psychological and terrific aspects from this nonsense event where more than three millions lost their lives . Especially at the west front. Here is shown the German side with the destiny of soldiers in this combat against the French. Cinematography is fine and the costumes were accurately done. The sceneries and atmosphere were well created to feel the audience in this nightmare.Congratulations to all the staff. 8/10.If you like war movies check the mini series Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan.",8/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"I've just came out from the European gala premier of the movie on ZFF 18. Was quite a bit a thing which gave me goosbumps that Daniel Brühl literally watched the movie first time ever with us (2 rows in front of me..); he spoke super passionately about the project and how they've made it. Edward Berger and James Friend don't really wait a single screenshot to catapult and slingshot the audience into the futile and meaningless horrors of war itself. From the very beginning until the very end the visual allegories (fox holes, mist, snowing, gloomy clouds and occasional raining etc.) are just persistent throughout to reinforce the message that its ""All quiet on the western front"", the over looming threat of artillery barrage and chemical attacks. First lead actor Felix Kammerer does a superb job to play Paul Bäumer the primary protagonist with enough and convincing naïveté that you believe that among with his fellow brothers and friends (Albert, Haie, Friedrich, Kat, Tjaden) are indeed real life human beings who totally at the mercy of chance and randomness to live or die, even when they have to constantly fight for their survival. The action scenes on the other hand blew me away, I rarely watch things with an open mouth but this movie achieved it around mid-way when the Germans did an offensive and the French countered that with tanks among other things... The madness, the futility and the overall barbaric nature of survival is portrayed so well that its really true to the forewords Erich Maria Remarque gave to his novel: ""This book is to be neither an accusation nor a confession, and least of all an adventure, for death is not an adventure to those who stand fact to face with it. It will try simply to tell of a generation of men who, even though they may have escaped shells, were destroyed by the war.""This, this is literally the German WWI war movie and story. Very well portrayed and well made film which I'm anticipating to win the Best Picture Oscar 2023.",10/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"Just got off watching this Netflix version of the classic.I vaguely remember the 1979 version with Ernest Borgnine (7/10) and I certainly remember watching the original 1930 film. Both powerful in their own ways. The 1930 film is the best of the three - with first class black & white photography, and all done in that particular way of German story telling. In 1930, the events were very recent - just 13 years previous. Every male over age 30 in German cinemas would have had direct experience. It must have been awful for those audiences to watch the apocalyptic battlefield scenes - still some of the most graphic and numbing ever filmed. My rating 8/10.So how does this one from Netflix in 2022 stand up then? Well sadly, not that tall.It's bleak, graphic, actually depressing. An assault on the senses. Sure - it really conveys the impression of the horrors and desperation of trench warfare. But that's all. Maybe that's all it's supposed to do? Maybe that's, as a matter of fact all there was: mayhem and horror? There's nothing to redeem it. Again - that's the point: there's nothing good or glorius about war. Only the opposite.The men who went to war then, as now, are not all evil men bent on barbarism and terror. All Quiet on the Western Front (all versions) shows us that those who go to war are just normal people - people like you and me. Good people go to war. Normal people. They end up having to see terrible things, do terrible things, to kill or be killed. That's the stark reality. This film certainly shows us that, but there is no upside, no redemption. There are little glimpses of humanity in the friendships, but that's all.",7/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"From its brutally minimalist staccato soundtrack, its consistently excellent cinematography and numerous memorable scenes, this movie is an impressive attempt to envisage the hellish existence of the average soldier on the Western Front.My only regret is I didn't watch this at the cinema.For the participants and victims, no war can be said to be better or worse than another, yet there is something about the combination of devastating machinery and almost medieval hand-to-hand combat; the mind-boggling numbers of people involved in the war of attrition; the constant inhuman degradation, suffering and industrialised slaughter of WW1, that makes it stand out.This was the war that should have ended all wars.Daily life in the trenches must have been awful enough: exposure to extreme temperatures, lack of sleep, hunger, disease, boredom, loneliness and despair, literally stuck in mud for days, months, even years. Add to that the constant threat of poisonous gas, artillery bombardment, snipers, drowning in the collapse of trenches or the dreaded command to 'go over the top' and face almost certain death, injury or loss.Imagine living day-to-day in this hellscape - often side by side with the rotting corpses of your friends.To many of us, living in relative comfort, these experiences are unimaginable.Watch it for the visceral experience. Contemplate it whenever you catch yourself feeling sorry for yourself.",10/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"I watched this last night after much anticipation. I was fairly quickly surprised by how soon in the film we got to the front.Where was the schoolroom and Baumer looking out of the window, daydreaming and sketching?Where was the baiting of the postman (to become training corporal) Himmelstoss?Where was the training, the mud field, the bullying by Himmelstoss? Kemmerich's boots getting passed from man to man as the owners died. The visit home and Paul's realisation that his family and home was now the front.We didn't really get to know the boys.The actual war stuff is impressive and I would imagine it was reasonably realistic (I wasn't at Western Front myself) but there wasn't actually much of a story, it was just war for war's sake, but maybe that was the point?It did borrow a couple of bits from the novel, Paul's stabbing the French soldier then his regret over it, the crippled soldier in hospital trying to kill himself, but then Kat's death? No, not like that, Kat was a hardened, wiley experienced soldier, he'd not have been caught out like that and it is unlikely they would have been unarmed in that situation.It is good the way that they work the story in to the last hours of the war but that is missing the whole point of AQOTWF.The point is that when Paul dies (either reaching for the butterfly or trying to sketch the bird as in the previous versions, I can't remember how EMR wrote it in the book) it isn't the end of the war, it is just another day during the war.The communique at the end of those earlier versions says simply ""all quiet on the Western Front"" and the point is a man has just died but as far as anyone is concerned there's nothing going on, its just another day the same as those before and those to follow. That is the poignancy of Paul's death and the example of how worthless life had become.This new version misses that point with its last set piece battle in the few minutes before armistice at 11am on November 11th 1918. Paul heroically (albeit reluctantly) going over the top one last time and dying fighting in a trench, Remarque wrote the death of Baumer as futile and pointless whilst he was just trying to snatch a moment of normality, a moment of his carefree previous existence.This doesn't mean the film is without merit, it really did happen that there were flurries of intense fighting and killing in the last few hours of the war, this wasn't some made up idea to add extra drama, which in itself is a sad indictment of humanity.This was a brilliant, thought provoking, stunning film that during its course borrowed some bits from All Quiet On The Western Front... but it wasn't All Quiet On The Western Front.",8/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"Good enough for an audience that does not know the book written by Mr. Remarque nor the first two movie adaptions. This ""based"" on movie got some well done battle scenes, but that's about it - the implementation of the new stuff (scenes of peace negotiations and debates between politicians and officers) destroys to a certain degree the intentions of Remarques book (who focuses on the grunts and common people at home only). And no doubt, there are some parts that felt lengthy to me - whereas I did watch the movie adaptions of 1930 and 1979 with awe - a couple of times. I dare to say that anything that the script writers implemented new or changed from the book are inferior and unnecessary detours. Also - despite that long running time - the characters are not well introduced, I did not care for one of them. Bad is also the music, score - those drones and music do not fit well to the scenario given. Last note: all those reviewers claiming that this is the best WWI movie do for sure not know those other movie adaptions or e.g. Kubrick's Paths of Glory. Anyway, for a Netflix production not bad but for sure nothing remarkable.",5/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"Just watched AQOTWF at the Showroom, Sheffield. This film pulls no punches whatsoever.It's depiction of trench warfare is staggering. The terrible living conditions the soldiers were forced to endure, the randomness of death and the unimaginable fear of going ""over the top.""I never thought the beach scene from Private Ryan could be matched, but the battle scenes in this film certainly come close. Superb action sequences.I liked the linear narrative of the story too. So many directors use flashbacks, but this film ""eases"" you into the lives of the main characters really well. We first meet the young soldiers at the recruitment station and journey with them all the way the Western Front, the tension increasing as their initial, patriotic enthusiasm ebbs away, only to be replaced with terror and confusion.The whole movie is in German and French. An excellent decision. This is not about the British Army at all, so to have hired English speaking actors would have been entirely inappropriate.This is an outstanding film and deserves to be recognised accordingly. It is not, however, any easy watch. The violence takes some stomaching and the ultimate fate of all the main characters is upsetting. Nobody wins and there are no heroes.The only reason I didn't give this masterpiece a 10 is because of the annoying ""rock chords"" that were played randomly throughout the film.Go and see All Quiet on the Western Front. You won't be disappointed.",9/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"Erich Maria Remarque's 1929 novel provides the loose basis for the movie. It's an anti-war war movie that follows a young German soldier who initially entered the war with enthusiasm but encountered only fear, violence, and death as pawns of generals who care little for the lives of their soldiers.Paul Bäumer (Felix Kammerer) and four or five of his high school classmates enthusiastically signed up for the war in 1918. The film quickly shifts to late in the war and their experiences at the front. A more experienced non-commissioned officer, Stanislaus ""Kat"" Katczinsky (Albrecht Schuch), proves very helpful in their survival. However, brutal battles gradually reduce their numbers, with seeming chance and villainous generals responsible for the final deaths.A parallel sub-plot in the movie follows Matthias Erzberger's (Daniel Brühl) diplomatic efforts to negotiate an armistice with Marshall Foch and follows a German general's determination to fight right up to the actual armistice.Unfortunately, the film departs too often from the book's plot and focuses only on the last two months of the war. It virtually ignores the book's first half, and a sub-plot seems artificially included. The lack of the earlier context means the focus is mainly on battles, bad conditions, and visual dramatics with little nuance on the psychological changes in Bäumer and his friends.That said, there are some profound scenes, particularly the one in which Paul Bäumer is in a bomb crater with a French soldier. The battle scenes are appropriately dramatic and use techniques borrowed from better films like ""1917"". Unfortunately, this movie is nowhere close to the quality of the 1930 original film.",6/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"This was probably the most spectacularly shot war film I've seen in a long time. It felt very real and gritty with the amazing cinematography, realistic sets and landscapes, and spot-on visual effects, prosthetics and carnage.The big problem that I had with this film is co-writer and director Edward Berger's overzealous constant display of useless, and dragged out shots. The entire film is stuffed with style over substance, with many useless scenes that needed to end up on the cutting room floor. It's like this film wasn't even edited/cut down. An example is the French ruler on the train asking if the croissant was made today; who cares. It's ok to throw in the odd metaphor here and there, but there were far too many - in addition to the constant shots of an empty forest, the sky, etc, that added nothing to the film except annoyance. Sure there were undeniably powerful moments, but they were overshadowed by all over-stylization and lesser involving narrative that we've all seen in more inspiring war films. All three writers seemed to enjoy long sequences where very little of interest happens, and the little interest there is, is milked to the maximum time.If this was cut down to about a 90 min runtime, the tension and suspense would be more appreciated and the narrative more engaging. And that's a shame, because this was so beautifully and realistically shot, with outstanding casting and performances, but had the writing and directing been better, this film would've been great, instead of just good. The score was very fitting - with the exception of the random outbursts of ear-pounding loud sound effects. It's a decent one-time watch if you have 148 mins to invest with nothing better to watch - even if just to appreciate the scope of the production values and excellent performances.",7/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"There are war movies and war movies. This is one of the great ones that treat war for what it is: that there are no winners, only losers.I have watched films about WWI from the point of view of the victors. This is my first time to watch it from the perspective of the other side.But, always, it's young people who have to fight it underscoring, at it emphatically does, a great loss for an entire generation.Felix Kammerer and Albrecht Schuch vividly portray the angst, despair and fear that soldiers feel in the trenches amid all the incessant violence.The story itself is heart-rending as it tackles, in no uncertain terms, the tenuousness of
living and the swiftness of death.A counterpoint is the frenetic effort of the peacemakers to end the war. Matthias Erzberg is a real person. His efforts to end the war is juxtaposed with the irrational desire of generals to continue the fruitless war.It has been said by other reviewers that it is a timely piece of cinema given the war in Ukraine. Man never learns. As pundits say, it's not history that repeats itself; it's man who repeats himself.We have to thank a great cinematography that brings to vivid life the gore of war. Ditto a musical score that ushers in the impending doom.Watch it soon and be disturbed.",10/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"In the 2022 version we witness Paul suffering and, apart from some half-baked political scenes, that's about it. In the 1930s version, and the book, Paul learns empathy for his enemy and grows as a human being because of the suffering he witnesses in others (including his 'enemy').It's a small difference of perspective but has huge implications.This is equivalent to a piece of art that moves and changes you as a person (1930s version) versus a computer algorithm that makes you believe you are the center of the world (2022). In that respect, it certainly captures the mood of the times.It's well-shot but not as historically accurate as some would have you believe (tanks not supported by infantry? Germans shooting endlessly at them with no effect and not retreating? Flame-throwers showing up immediately afterward and then biplanes as well! I'd love to know what battle that's supposed to be.)Fans of war films will get some entertainment but not a lot of think about beyond the basic and tired, 'war is hell'. And for that, it misses the point of the original by a wide margin.",4/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"As an anti-war film, this rendition of All Quiet on the Western Front succeeds. It is a good rendering of the futility of war. But, that aside, it is a far cry from its title parent, and shares little in common with that supposed source. The novel, and the original film from the 1930s, are far better.This film fails on several fronts. First, it is somber to the point of parody. It clearly draws on the horror elements of other films like ""Come and See"", and is arguably even inspired by the more recent ""1917"". The problem is that it relies on this somber solemness to the point of excluding its story. The characters are barely developed. There is hardly any dialogue to get us to feel sympathy for any character except Kat. It relies far too heavily on visuals (like Come and See).Second, the story is disjointed. We see 4 friends join up in 1917. In their first battle, one is killed, but somehow the other three survive all the way to the last days of the war? And then, we see a very stunted depiction of the peace process and its resulting discontent for the Germans. In short, the film is trying to do far too much.Third, much of the disjointedness is illogical. In the original novel, we are not told specifically when the men join up, but it is far earlier in the war. Most depictions show them in Picklehaube helmets, which the Germans abandoned well before 1917. Here, we see a teacher rousing his students' patriotism in 1917. This is after the Turnip Winter, and I have a hard time believing that anyone would have been naive enough to think that the war was going well, if not badly, but that point. Heck, by 1917 much of the French army was on the brink of mutiny, and Germany wasn't that much better off.Then, we see the final charge by the Germans, right as peace is signed. I mean, some German commanders certainly wanted to do this, but none of them actually made so cruel and callous an order, and I firmly believe had a general done so from a balcony as depicted here, one of his soldiers would have shot him themselves, ESPECIALLY after he has told them that the war is ending. Again, by this point, nobody on the front lines really wanted to continue the fight outside of a few fanatics.The acting is good. The visuals are astounding. It works as anti-war film, but it's just not a very good one.",4/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"Just finished watching this latest version of the classic All Quiet on the Western Front. While the acting, and action were top notch, the movie misses the point of the story. Not that ""war is bad"" that is an easy thing to grasp onto. But that the glorification of war drives men to war. For that we need to see the protagonist and his friends before the war and at the start of the war. We really need to get to know these young men and why they would have been excited about war. Instead the movie starts unfathomably in 1917, when the horrors of the war would be well known-not only with the casualties but the starvation and deprivation on the home front caused by the Allied blockade. Young men at this point would not be excited to go to war. That is the first disconnect the viewer experiences.This version attempts to contrast the foot soldiers with the generals, but jams most of the story within a few days of the armistice. Around an hour into the movie and the story is 3 days from end of the war. That is a huge leap especially given how much action has to occur over the next 3 days and 1 and 1/2 hour of movie. The second disconnect occurs. The viewer is lost in regards to a time. The movie should be wrapping up.The substitution of the home front for the generals was a logical choice-the film maker gets to compare the lot of the leaders with the lot of the foot soldiers. And the theme of the ""stab in the back"" gets alot of play. But the problem is the ""stab in the back"" relates to the seeds of WW2, not the war that was just ending. I suppose the message is war is inevitable, but I think that muddies the themes unnecessarily.The basic issue the movie has is that it is about more than the experiences of the young man facing war. That change dulled the impact of the moving scenes like Paul and Frenchman and the hospital and Kat's death. Oh and Kat's death was beyond bad-not the acting. The point of his death is that it is futile and a waste of a good man-Paul's father figure-his good angel. And the war killed him. Not the son of a farmer he robbed. UGH. That death completely changes Kat's story.It is not all bad, there was a great deal of emotion in the battle scenes-true terror like when the tanks attacked. But still the action seemed more heroic than should be appropriate for AQotWF. Especially when compared to the deaths which did seem wasteful.Overall, excellent cinematography, acting, action scenes, setting, historical accuracy, direction. My problem is with the script, it changed the themes to the detriment of the heart of the AQotWF story. I can understand what they tried and for the most part they succeeded, but still it was a poor choice to make.",6/10
Im Westen nichts Neues (2022),"Just saw this at a screening. It is a film, that from one minute in, you know you are going to witness a superior masterpiece, that will not disappoint in any way. And it doesn't.It is so incredible, from cinematography to music to acting to special effects to wardrobe and everything that goes into creating a feature film.It is not getting a full theatrical release, which is almost criminal. It's going to be on Netflix, and I hope it gets some serious viewership. But seeing this on the big screen, is all the reason people used to go to ""the movies"". It's an experience that really has the power to make people think.How unusual and refreshing.If you're lucky enough to be able to see this in a theater, run, and catch it, and you'll be a better human being.",10/10
Infinity Pool (2023),"I'm upset that I'm giving this such a low review. I just felt like it didn't really amount to anything except for shock for the sake of shock and weirdness for the sake of weirdness. The movie didn't really accomplish anything that wasn't previously accomplished by superior films in similar veins such as Speak No Evil. The visuals were admittedly cool and the overall aesthetic of the movie was well done, but what was the point? It ultimately just amounted to being a very pretentious, try hard, extreme film for commercial audiences. I felt like it tried very hard to be thought provoking when it was really just leaving out details and not really finishing anything it started with. On top of that, the ending scenes with Mia Goth freaking out were very hard to take seriously. I wasn't sure if the director meant for it to be comedic or not.D+",4/10
Infinity Pool (2023),"I saw ""Infinity Pool"" last night in the theatre. It is a very strange movie directed by Brandon Cronenberg, the son of David Cronenberg (""Videodrome"", ""The Fly"", etc.) It is about a couple (Alexander Skarsgård and Cleopatra Coleman) who travel to a luxury resort in a repressive dictatorship. They meet another couple (Jalil Lespert and Mia Goth) who convince them to travel off the grounds of the resort, even though it is prohibited by the rules of the resort and country. Soon a tragedy occurs, and the couple is thrust into a fever dream of drugs, sex and violence. Mia Goth is excellent as the temptress who pushes Skarsgård's character into doing things he would never think of doing. Skarsgård is wasted in this role and his character takes actions that defy common sense. And while some have praised Brandon Cronenberg's direction - I found some of the strange angles and quirks he uses to be more annoying than ingenious. There is a surfeit of sex, violence and gore for those who enjoy that, but I cannot say that it really added anything to a convoluted plot that really makes no sense. Only recommended for Mia Goth's standout performance - wait for cable or Netflix on this one. 5/10.",5/10
Infinity Pool (2023),This film totally misses it's mark. It tries so hard to be bizarre and abstract but ends up being pretentious and annyoing. I honestly have no idea why people like this film. I could barely get through it and honestly couldn't wait for it end. I normally like Mia Goth films but this one didn't do it for me. She was super cringe in this. Especially in the scene where she's riding on the front of the car. Her screeching voice almost made my head explode. How this film has a rating above six stars is beyond me. This is definitely not a film I'd recommend or torture myself by sitting through again. 4 stars.,4/10
Infinity Pool (2023),"This type of movie is shock value and that's it.There is no value in the story and or the attempt at scares.Big budget , great acting , fancy editing and bizarre sequences, but this movie really goes no where .kinda like it's characters in the plot.I guess when all the good ideas have been used the only thing left is shock and gore .Sad no one spends the time to think things out and develop a scary story and use atmosphere and tension .This movie has atmosphere and tension but it's of the lower kind .I miss great hope like the Changeling , and Exorcist ( which used shock and gore but in a much effective way) .If this movie is trying to say something it's that people with connections and money get away with murder .",1/10
Infinity Pool (2023),"This film had the potential to be something new and creative in the horror genre, but wirter/director Brandon Cronenberg settles for more of the same of his usual style with little in the way of an understanding of why these events are occuring or even caring that they are happening. Now, I am a fan of his. Antiviral and Possessor are fantastic films that benefit from his particular brand of trippy visuals and existential analysis. The difference between those films and his latest effort is he does little to help build tension and does nothing to make us care for any of the characters he has written. They are all terrible people, not one of them worth redemption.All the acting is very well done, Mia Goth is always a sure bet when playing a sinister crazy person. Alexander Skarsgård, unfortunately, isn't given enough material here to truly shine in his role. He's a practically one dimensional shell of a character, and that is one of the main reasons the film did not work for me. I felt nothing for his character, and the character makes some of the worst decisions I've seen on film. Barely any of the film makes sense if I'm being honest. Best not to ask why to any of the questions you have because, more than likely, they will not be answered. Seriously, the movie will bring up a point and then completely ditch it the next minute. It was a frustrating watching experience.I would like to see the NC-17 director's cut just to see how much of the depravity was actually cut out of the film as I felt this one was rather tame, minus a heated and trippy orgy segment that was pretty graphic for an R rated film. But violence wise, I felt the film didn't go far enough and what was shown was just too strange and disconnected for it to have any impact.Then we come to the ending. Wtf was that? He just decides to stay? Why? Everybody left! There was nothing left to do, why would he not go home himself? Also, he didn't even try to get even with the people who just destroyed his entire life for their amusement? Then what was the purpose of any of this story? It didn't really have one from what I could tell. Disappointing.Overall, I only recommend it when it's free on a streaming service. Otherwise, I would say don't bother. Only reason I'm not giving it a 0 is because it was well made. The trippy cinematography was on point, but that was about it.1.5 cults out of 5.",3/10
Infinity Pool (2023),"We stayed in hopes it will get better, and it only got worse smh. Too many questions, no answers. No clue at all what this movie is about. This film was all over the place, it delivered nothing, except for confusion and excessive It was one of those films that I completely disliked, Literally probably the worst movie I have ever seen, half the theatre left, the rest shouted in relief and anger when it was over. Truly awful. Literally the most pointless movie I have ever seen. He gets cloned because he killed someone and the original person gets to die then the clone did another crime so that clone dies and another one cloned. See already lost me like there was no point to the movie what so ever. What point was it? Where was the point of the entire thing? No suspense or even explanation in the movie at all.

Infinity Pool (2023),"I walked into this movie knowing little to nothing other than Brandon Cronenberg was at the helm, and Mia Goth was staring. I heard it was artsy, and ""disturbing"" but that should've meant it was right up my alley. What I found out was that, while the film's acting + visuals + base story concept were good....it just felt a little underwhelming.Let's start with what was good. Like I said, the acting is pretty good from the two main leads. Mia Goth goes over the top, and Alexander Skarsgard goes more realistic and human, which is a good contrast. Visuals are pretty good, same with the sound. The story has a premise that will get you interested in the first 30 minutes, dealing with a rich resort and a local government that loves to clone. However, this is where it has problems.The story and characters are its biggest problem. They're not bad per se, but they are not are par with the rest of the film. I feel like the cronenbergs always have great ideas, but cannot execute on the characters and fleshing out of the story. You don't relate to the main character ""James"" all that much. I can sympathise with him, and I kinda liked him but it just wasn't enough. Same with Mia Goth, you never see why the way she is other than maybe inferences (stuff that would spoil the movie). It just needed a special something in the story department to top it off, but we don't get that.If you like these types of experimental and artsy movies, then I would recommend giving it a shot (you love it). However, if you're more of a casual movie goer, you can probably skip. Unless you wanna pop a couple edibles and have a very weird night. However, Avatar or Puss in Boots would probably give you a better experience in that department.",5/10
Infinity Pool (2023),"Infinity Pool, the latest from writer/director Brandon Cronenberg, focuses on James and Em Foster, on vacation to help James clear his head in order to attempt writing his second novel. James and Em meet and are guided by a mysterious couple also vacationing outside of the resort to find themselves stuck in a culture packed with sex, violence, and unimaginable terrors. After a fatal vehicular accident leaves them facing the wrath of local law enforcement, James and Em are faced with a decision: be executed for their crime or, if rich enough, watch themselves die. What results is a downward plunge into debauchery, murder, and desperation.Infinity Pool stars Alexander Skarsgård and Mia Goth. Fresh off his tilt as Amleth in 2022's The Northman, Skarsgård plays a very different character here. In Infinity Pool Skarsgård is James Foster, struggling writer married to Em Foster, daughter of a power publisher and the couple's breadwinner. An amenable guy, James is enjoying his vacation with Em at Lotoka, a beachside country. Skarsgård plays James with the air of a man a bit adrift in life, clinging onto Em as a comfortable life raft. As an actor used to playing characters with power (see: True Blood) or iron determination (Mute, The Northman), Skarsgård takes a surprising turn as a meek, easily-lead man. While the change of pace is refreshing, Skarsgård's portrayal of James is nothing noteworthy. His passable acting is enough to offset the insanity that is Mia Goth.Mia Goth as Gabi Bauer is trouble from the first moment she appears on screen until her final. A performance that starts unsettling before ramping up to completely unhinged, Goth milks every ounce of craziness she can from the script. While it's not always for the best (Goth has some truly questionable line readings in this), she's by far the overall best part of the movie. While her characterization is maddening, the motivations Cronenberg gives Gabi are nebulous at best. Thankfully, that's no fault of Goth's and when she shows up on screen, audiences are in for a treat.Written and directed by Brandon Cronenberg, Infinity Pool is the director's second outing after 2020's amazing debut, Possessor. Sadly, the sophomore slump is apparent in his second project, giving audience and body horror fans a lackluster followup that's unfocused and meandering. From a directing standpoint, Cronenberg is still sharp, delivering tension and suspense along with the cringe-inducing scenes the family is known for. Extreme closeups of mutilation, murder, and blood by the buckets (topped off with a cumshot in the film's first 30 minutes) will put moviegoers on their backfoot while being completely vulnerable to whatever could happen next. Cinematographer Karim Hussain, who also shot the beautiful Possessor, delivers on the goods again, providing a remarkable visual journey that James embarks upon. Cronenberg's choice to shoot Infinity Pool in Croatia, one of the planet's most beautiful countries, while mostly resisting the opportunity to display that beauty and instead focus on the grime and side streets is a commendable decision that lines up with tone of the movie.As a writer, after tackling the theme of identity loss in an increasingly technological world in Possessor, in Infinity Pool no such messages seem to exist outside of a general human desensitivity to death. The first act might be the story's strongest, developing characters and creating situations that will entice the audience to be locked in and attentive. Unfortunately in the second act turn, where everything starts to fall apart for James, is also where everything will fall apart for the audience. James' descent into depravity, while interesting to look at in a well executed montage of sex and psychedelics, ultimately leads to a chaotic story with little in the way of explanation or true resolution.Overall, Infinity Pool is a mess of a movie. Within that mess are hints at something good, possibly great, but Cronenberg seems to be too in love with the idea of creating something off kilter more than telling an actual story. Alexander Skarsgård's performance is passable as a man lost in hedonism, while Mia Goth's unhinged insanity somehow fluctuates between amazing and downright lousy. Lacking the usual amount of body horror audiences have come to expect from the name Cronenberg, this film instead chooses to skate by on its ambience, which doesn't always work in its favor.",5/10
Infinity Pool (2023),"Well Infinity Pool was absolutely demented and came from a mind of Brandon Croenberg he seems truly effed in the head for creating this film; great for horror fans and I loved everything regardless. The imagery belongs in hell! This film is something very odd, trippy, filled with madness, and not for everyone. The Cronenberg's have a common horror weirdness they are fairly brilliant. To me the movie gets praise because it's art despite being ghoulish and bonkers there's a lot to enjoy like the writing is incredible, flow of the story is great, and highly entertaining throughout I especially love the masks used in several scenes. I recommend and hope anyone appreciates my opinions.",9/10

Infinity Pool (2023),"7.1. Seriously. All those 10's? Listen up. Here it is only jan 23 and we have the worst movie of the year. Top to bottom, this thing stinks. Briefly, a couple on vacation in some exotic and dangerous place find themselves in trouble right off the bat. Things go down hill fast, especially with a husband as stupid as this guy. There is a great deal of so called psychedelic gobbly gook, which takes up a lot of screen time and requires zero acting. I kept wondering if this skarsgard is the same one i have liked so often. Maybe he's one of the duplicates from the film. If this is art, we are in for a very long year. I heard that this was a terrifying experience. Laughable, would be a better description, .

Infinity Pool (2023),"I think if they just got to the point right away it would have made a bigger impact on me. The beginning scenes took way too long to develop and I was getting frustrated with the slow pace. When the arrests happened I definitely got intrigued. But they let the foot off the gas and descended into a bunch of childish rubbish.This would be the murder capital of the world. Unfortunately, the only ones dying are the poor natives. Given human nature this country would run out of citizens really quick.Interesting subject but the movie focused on the thrills rather than the consequences. Its hard to feel anything for the characters. Even the natives come across as farm animals.",2/10
Infinity Pool (2023),"From 'gosh it looks like a Cronenberg movie' to 'gosh it is his son's movie' is one step. Unfortunately a pretty long step. Indeed, it is in the combination of the very strong influence of his father's filmography with the attempt to break away from it that Infinity Pool finds its undoing. The film lacks so much structure, cohesion, and meaning that it is difficult to give it a well-structured review.Starting with the premise, the film immediately fails to get the viewer oriented in the world it wants to tell about: are we in our reality? In an alternative one? Li Tolqa's costumes are unusual, but outside of it, is our morality that of the protagonists? The film would lean toward making us understand that Li Tolqa is a fictitious place, yet immersed in our reality. With the main characters we should consequently share morals. If this is indeed the case, the fictional reality of the film cannot stand on itself in the slightest, as it is too improbable. If, on the other hand, this is not the case, the film fails miserably in making us understand what key we should give to what we see depicted on the screen. This makes it, yes disturbing, but overall alienating to the viewer of the story. The result is too full, too confusing, too eager to provoke and disturb to have a defined identity. The use of continuous technical virtuosity also contributes to the sensation of overall overabundance of the story.This is not to say that there were not many elements of potential interest, or that the director lacks skill and talent, but how the entire production fell short in reducing, deducting, and correcting all those elements that separate an experimental film from a messy one.",5/10
Infinity Pool (2023),"The concept behind the plot is interesting, but it is so poorly executed I almost walked out. It was shot like it was a done by a film student trying to use every non-standard technique he's learned. From weird framing to odd psychedelic scenes, it's way too much. Additionally the acting was just plain bad, but having seen Alexander Skarsgard in other things, I'll blame the director for that too. And the female antagonist was just soooooo annoying that I found it hard to believe the main character would go along with anything she wanted. Had this movie been in more capable hands, it might have been OK, but as it is don't bother seeing it.",3/10
Infinity Pool (2023),"Infinity Pool is another derivative, cliché-ridden attempt at a dime-a-dozen satire of immoral wealthy people, complete with all the pretentious, amateurish filmmaking tropes - flashing lights and chaotic editing for cheap ""psychedelic"" effect, ample yet unconvincing gore for cheap shock value, tasteless pornography to seem self-serious (and for more shock value), and awful, dreadful, eye-rollingly poor overacting from most of the cast (especially from Mia Goth; her performance is laughable in its desperation). All in all, this is a very poor (and let's just say it: likely nepotism-fueled) attempt at an emulation of Cronenberg Sr., and it falls flat on its face at every turn. Every big twist in the story can be seen from a mile away by anyone with a brain who has seen a horror/sci-fi film before - and I do mean *every* twist. It almost reaches undergrad film school-level of predictable, although I won't be quite that harsh. It is, nevertheless, pretty damn bad.",3/10
Infinity Pool (2023),"You ever watch a movie that, when the credits started rolling, you felt like you had just finished an 8 hour shift at a super demanding job? This is one of those movies. While it starts off pretty tame, it quickly devolves into absurdity, with each act more ridiculous than the last. While the premise is certainly unique and the movie should be lauded for that alone, the execution came off as more annoying than thought provoking, more anger inducing than entertainment. I mean, how many times can you watch the same thing happen in a film without thinking if that's all the movie has to offer? I just don't think a lot was accomplished after that initial shock has worn off and the shock loop was played more than 2 times.I will say this; for a movie about being able to pay to have a clone of you die for you in the event you commit a heinous crime, every single character in this movie deserved to have that privilege denied to them because they were just completely rotten. There was no one to root for in this movie, as everyone was equally horrible in every conceivable way. Like the cast of any reality show, it is more about not being able to look away from the train wreck than actually worrying about how many people are hurt.In the end, this film rubbed me the wrong way because it felt like it was a secret kink of the people involved being given life in art; to be able to commit disgusting, horrifying acts of depravity and violence, while not having to suffer any real consequences from them. Basically, being able to buy their way out of trouble. Was it an overt commentary on the culture of the super rich, and how they exploit less developed nations for their own twisted and perverse reasons while never having to answer for their crimes against humanity?I am a fan of this director, and I think he is an immensely talented individual that makes thought provoking and engaging films. This one was not made for fans like me. I loved Possessor, and watched it multiple times. I struggled to finish this one.That should tell you everything you need to know.",5/10
Infinity Pool (2023),"Infinity Pool can't decide it's theme or what it wants to be. Reviewers speak to its satire and atmospheric horror, but the film struggles to deliver a visual or narrative approach befitting of either genre. It's caught between being an art house film project, a vacation horror, and a cultural mirror/satire.A major problem with IP is that it's gratuitous without value. This wouldn't be a problem if the movie was comfortably a horror, but it's not. It's a bit more pretentious and strives to overcome a shallow plot by throwing a nauseating (and overdone) drug trip montage and senseless sexuality at the viewer.Other issues include the main character's ""arc"", or confusion thereof. The plot had fertile ground to explore what it's like to watch yourself die, but the pacing jumps the gun. The switch from horror to amusement is fast, only to be contradicted when they attempt a moral redemption when he discovers the person he's beating isn't who he thinks it is. This non-adherance to theme development seriously detracts from IP's quality. And that goes without saying the final act is so horrifically bad and needless I was inclined to walk out.The Prestige does a much better job addressing the psychological horror of having a double/clone, and Midsommar does a much better job of being cultural satire, and atmospheric horror. At least the latter has a rhyme and reason for it's graphic gore and nudity, given its setting.This one is entirely passable.",3/10
Infinity Pool (2023),"Right from the start I was a bit lost because I was unable to understand the actors who portrayed the police in the film. I think this was due in part to their heavy accents or just them talking pretty low. Eventually I was able to understand what was going on and thought it would get interesting.It was actually the opposite. The violence and the gore was tolerable. The nudity was excessive with one scene being too drawn out. It could have been toned down without affecting the story. Mia Goth does a great job playing crazy but I felt she could have been used in a more brutal way. Her character was used in a more seductive and manipulative way. She did a great job doing both of those things, I just wanted more especially with the concept of this film.I didn't care too much for Alexander Skarsgard's character. He did fall into this game that was being played but the morality of it all was never really questioned. His character should have captured the emotional affects of what was going on in a more dramatic fashion. The only time he showed any kind of emotion was when he was afraid of seeing himself being used for entertainment.Cleopatra Coleman who played Skarsgard's wife was basically a wasted character who could have easily been eliminated from the story entirely.The plot of this story basically went nowhere. It was just event after event that gave the audience hope for a great reveal or twist but in the end didn't do either. The movie could have been more entertaining considering the amount of violence it had. It felt like it dragged at times. Just one of those films with a great idea, but wasn't executed to its fullest potential.I give it 3 stars for Mia Goth, movie concept and some of the visual elements.",3/10

Infinity Pool (2023),"Cronenberg the Younger is a legitimate and rare guerilla artiste. In the same class as Nicolas Winding Refn. He has mad skills and, should he ever wish to do a blockbuster, or a traditional Hollywood film, he could hit the heights. But he does not. Instead, he uses his considerable skillset to get under the skin of the audience, and take the art of cinema in a direction that few have tried. The most dangerous thing in the entertainment industry is an entertainer who does not care if he entertains. We saw this in POSSESSOR and we see it again in Infinity Pool.

Well let's be realistic; he is very far from his father.ANTIVIRAL was barely OK and PROCESSOR was better but still not a masterpiece. Well this one INFINY POOL is a big step down.Having to good actors like Skarsgard and Goth doing one dimensional characters does not help the move. The absurd game of close up and bad filmed scenes neither. But the script is just to absurdly nuts that loses orientation in the middle of the movie.It is never clear is about corruption; rich people abusing others or just a non sense horror movie that has no horror at al.There are few good ideas but of the movie seems a copy of better others.

Infinity Pool (2023),"This film is another example of trying to follow in your dad's footsteps, and tripping. It takes some really good shrooms to come up with such eye-candy visuals, with a story that is absolute nonsense and defies all logic or reasoning. Don't get me wrong, the premise was brilliant, but the story that follows is nonsense. If you can, image what creative vomit would look like, there's your film. Had any small amount of rhyme or reason been thrown in, this may have been watchable.You're supposed to get better as a filmmaker the more films you make, yet here we have a film titled Infinity Pool, with zero logic to why that title was even selected - except for it mentioned in one irrelevant sentence throughout the film. At least say the word Cloning, and show it happens in an infinity pool-like laboratory, not some emptied out barn or closed down YMCA shower stall. I guess the shrooms wore off when it came time to select a title.Writer and director Brandon Cronenberg showed promise with his previous film Possessor 2020, as it at least had some sort of cohesive story to it, albeit convoluted and ridiculous, but at least it was a fair one-time watch I couldn't say was a waste of time. But this mess, it creates a big build up, with no reward at the end. The first act is a great set-up, but then the final two acts felt like bad SNL sketches, with a few scenes where the camera falls into multicolored paint buckets. It was all style and no substance, with a meaningless, shallow, and eye-roll inducing plot, that was even more convoluted and incoherent than his previous film. Think of it as getting dressed up to go to the ball, but ending up at a bunch of annoying drunkfest frat parties instead.It's a disappointing yet very generous 5/10 from me, all going towards a decent score, the cinematography, and Goth's performance.",5/10
Infinity Pool (2023),"""Infinity Pool"" follows James Foster, a struggling writer vacationing with his wife Em at a posh resort in a fictional third-world country. There, he meets Gabi and her husband, Alban. When an illicit trip outside the resort's gates leads to a tragic accident, James is faced with execution; or, as an alternative, the execution of a ""double"", a clone of himself, whose sacrifice he must bear witness to. What ensues is a rapid psychological downslide into vengeance, self-abasement, and debauchery.This twisted and imaginative effort from Brandon Cronenberg is sure to divide audiences, though it is not necessarily as overtly arthouse-y as one might expect. The plot setup here is quite familiar, at least at first: Fears and dangers of a third-world criminal justice system loom over the first act, replete with Stalinist prison settings and officers who look like they were pulled straight from the SS. A nervy score and dizzying cinematography plummet the audience toward an ""I Know What You Did Last Summer""-esque scenario that warps into something far beyond the familiar trappings of a frivolous slasher movie.There are voluminous thematic layers here to be unpeeled, and the film descends into a nightmarish scenario in which the protagonist finds himself at the hands of a cultish horde of self-proclaimed ""zombies"", others who have gone through the same ""doubling"" as a means of atonement for their crimes. The film forces its audience to contemplate shuddering notions in which one must kill off pieces of themselves, both figuratively and literally, and a masochistic pleasure in doing so emerges amongst Cronenberg's acid-trip visuals. Layered in, perhaps more interestingly, is a pronounced subtext that explores the relationship between the wealthy vacationers and the country's strange justice system, whose loophole offers them quasi-limitless possibilities to engage in crime and debauchery--but at what real cost?Alexander Skarsgard gives a solid performance here as the downtrodden writer who is doing some ""soul-searching"" for his belabored second work, while Mia Goth has her hand at what is essentially a classic femme fatale role, delivering an utterly deranged version of the archetype. Cleopatra Coleman stands counterpoint as James's heiress wife, who, unlike him, is deterred by the proverbial flame that he is drawn to like a moth.Overall, ""Infinity Pool"" is a nervy and frightening descent through a ""nine circles of hell"" scenario, shot through with a near-debilitating dose of speculative and science fiction. It is a film that taunts you as much as it makes you think, both to discomforting lengths. If one thing is for certain, an artistic representation of the writer's search for ""inspiration"" has never looked (or felt) so harrowing. 9/10.",9/10
Infinity Pool (2023),"I give this a big fat zero star. Just when I thought I had seen the worst movie, I decided to go see this one. Its just awful. How can this be? This movie has all the elements of a great movie, but it has no real story, or the story it tries to tell gets lost in drug induced crazy ville. I did enjoy the first quarter, but wanted to leave at the half mark. The wife is annoying and the other woman is just beyond terrible. I don't understand why someone thought this was a good idea? It reminded me of the stupid movies made in the 60s for some reason. I just want to warn people that have issues with crazy drug induced violence and sex scenes then this movie isn't for you.

Aside from an interminable psychedelic orgy scene that just wouldn't end, the movie didn't take the violence and depravity far enough.

Your Place or Mine (2023),"This one stays watchable thanks to a bright, buoyant-as-always Reese Witherspoon, but the writing and direction are on auto-pilot. For a film that pretentiously begins in 2003 and ends in 2023, there's very little actual romance or comedy here that grabs your sustained attention. The film just plods along in a familiar ""can best friends turn lovers?"" setup, the payoff of which is so minuscule and very 2003-like. Sure, it's not a film you'd ditch half-way, yet it has nothing that warrants a revisit - as is the case with most Netflix ""originals."" Also, a film like this would have actually benefited from having Kutcher and Witherspoon in the same space (to hell with those split-screens) a lot longer than 5 minutes tops. Hands up if you think Witherspoon deserves a better-written, better-directed comeback film! 🙌",4/10

The potential is there since we have been running out dry from rom-com movies with big stars.Also coincidently this movie comes out as I was in the mood for Legally Blonde and thus I'm in the mood for Reese Witherspoon.She looks fabulous here and Ashton also looks good to look at.Unfortunately, they don't have much interaction at all and the whole movie is just not that interesting. Not much comedy, not much chemistry between the main character due to their distance. Sleepless in Seattle developed more connection despite the long distance and communication through radio.Definitely a miss opportunity...I do like Zoe Chao's character. She's like the best friend to have. Supportive, rich, and fun to be around. A scene stealer.",6/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"First off, I really, really like ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" which I've watched repeatedly. This is the same writer.""Your Place"" to me is just facile and lazy writing. During the first hour, I kept debating whether to stick with it. Since there was nothing else on, and I was tired from the workweek, I did. When Jesse Williams (from Grey's Anatomy) showed up, I perked up because, well, it's Jesse Williams! The movie did start to move a little faster then. Faster but not better.There's no real tension in the movie until the last scene, which feels tacked on just so there can be a climactic ""I hate you, no - I love you!"" scene. Everyone gets what they want effortlessly. Want a top NYC editor to read your friend's book? Both he and his assistant read it overnight and of course, want to publish it. Debbie/Reese is taking a graduate class but never has to study. Want your friend's kid to be on the hockey team? Even though his mom hasn't let him play hockey, he makes it on the first try.It's a lot of telling, not showing. We're told they've had this 20 year best friendship, but we don't see anything that would lead us to think that. We're told they fell in love the first night, but we don't see it.I think because I already have good will towards Reese and Ashton, I automatically root for them from the top to the extent that I care, which isn't much.Zoe Chao is the one really funny character, but that may be more the actor than the writing. I was happy to see Steve Zahn but then his character was just dumb. The young actor playing Jack was very good. I didn't like it, though, when Jack was given preternatural insight for his age.There's no actual comedy, except for Zoe Chao. Maybe if the writer had rewritten it a bunch of times and made the dialogue better. I can't remember one line standing out or making me laugh.I know the writer can do much better, given she also wrote ""Devil Wears Prada.""",2/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"A standard romantic comedy that takes place in 2003. Directed by writer Aline Brosh McKenna, who has written many popular romantic comedies, including ""27 Dresses"" and ""The Devil Wears Prada,"" the film is a typical feel-good movie that is good for a lazy day on Netflix. Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher star as Debbie and Peter, who have been best friends for 20 years. They are opposites, with different lifestyles and personalities, and the movie follows their journey as they switch homes for a week. While the two lead actors are good-looking and charismatic, the film is let down by its bland script and lack of depth. The supporting characters, including Tig Notaro and Zoe Chao, are more interesting, but overall the movie is predictable and lacks any real twists or surprises.",6/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"To be honest the ""I don't want to ruin our friendship"" premise for romcoms is pretty common. However by the time you're in your 40s and you're still saying this it's kind of pathetic. Movies like this work better for characters in their 20s that have been friends since they were kids. The movie was generic, boring and predictable. Tig Notaro plays an interesting side character they both apparently have known for years but with no backstory as to how. Steve Zahn plays a silly gardener they attempt to utilize as comedy but really just comes off as a pointless character and quite frankly a waste of Steve's time. She briefly has an affair with a dude she has no chemistry with and like no other rom-com before (great sarcasm here) they kiss and make up at baggage claim in an airport after confessing their love for one another only a whopping 20 years later. Film seemed like a cash grab for both of them.",3/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"Which executive approved this project at Netfix? Worst script ever. Horrible director. Waste of money. How do these amateurs get away with it? Too many Netfix productions are horrible, but this one takes the cake. It's like when someone is making a movie for Netfix they don't take it seriously. They are paid up front and don't have to worrie about box-office figures, because of course everyone is gonna stream it... And if they don't, well, then who cares? Because we don't need to get out of bed and drive down to a cinema to watch it. I am sorry, but since streaming became King the movies became crap. There, I said it!",1/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"You can say it's cheesy, unoriginal, or old-fashioned, but it works for me. As a millennial, I was so excited to see Witherspoon and Kutcher, icons of rom-coms in early 2000s, come back as grown up couple, so I admit I can be biased. Plus, best friends-to-lovers trope always works on me. It is refreshing to see romance movie that two main characters do not spend much time together physically, but audience can sense their friendship has been strong partly because they have been friends to us millennial for a long time as well. Alicia who has watched their twenty years as a friend is one of us. Chemistry is still there just with phone calls or conversations even without physical interaction. I just missed rom-com with early 2000s vibe.",8/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"Netflix does it again, yet another comedy rom/com stinker. Seen so many of these types of films on netflix where straight away you see actors doing it for the money. Don't get me wrong occasionally Netflix gets it right and produces a good film but never in the comedy feel good rom/com type genre. This is another Netflix film that thinks this is what people want too see, and once again they get it completly wrong. No chemistry between the unbelievable characters who speak unbelievable dialogue in unbelievable situations. Who ever makes the decisions about what films too make at Netflix needs showing the door because time after time they get it spectacularly wrong.",1/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"I really wanted to like this movie as I am a fan of Reese Witherspoon and love her work. Normally. However watching it I asked myself what happened to her acting (mediocre and so not up to par with her other work), whatever happened to Ashton Kutcher's face, and whatever happened to their chemistry (virtually nonexistent). It's fine as light entertainment for an evening in when you're sick, but unfortunately not what I expected. I'm puzzled.The story is kind of foreseeable, the characters a little shallow. The best performance is by Steve Kirsch (in a minor role) who was the only one getting a giggle out of me.I like Witherspoons work so much that I almost feel guilty for being disappointed, but there you go...",5/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"I really wanted to love this. Really really, I love romcoms, it had a great cast, promising if cliched story, I still had high hope. Sadly I didnt love it, I barely liked it. And i have questions .............. if they are the best friends ever how have they never visited each others homes ? And also when Debbie can't get in touch with peter who is responsible for her son, being the helicopter Mum she is why is she not freaking out . Also it was waaaaay out of the blue the sudden romantic feelings for each other. It kinda came out of left field. I feel sad , I'd been waiting to watch this for weeks and then boom, the night of release arrived . I just felt let down 🙁",5/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"Let's start with the story as this is simple. The story makes no sense what so ever. It's empty, soulless & compassionless. Having a millionaire tech guru doing the garden of our heroine for free whilst he employs a gardener to do his own Garden. What is all that about?The main protagonists Reese Witherspoon is an aging actress starring in a film that should have been for a 20 year old something & not a 40 something. Ashton Kutcher is an appalling actor & between the pair of them there is zero chemistry zilch nada nothing. TBH there is zero chemistry between any of the actors. It's just a bunch of people saying stuff in different scenes which leaves me as the watcher not caring what happens to anyone. They even screwed up making the kid appealing.All I can say is that Netflix needs to be challenged by other film makers to stop this utter garbage from being made.",2/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"This film has great actors. The storyline offers plenty of opportunities. The acting isn't even bad. My 6 has been rounded upwards. The average is already below 6 while writing this review. This film is so dull and almost boring. Even the trailer is more funny than the entire film. Is it a comedy? Not really. Is it drama? Not really. Is it a romance movie? Perhaps for a few minutes. Is it dull? Yes and unfortunately. But why??? Is it related to Netflix quality control ? More and more, I'm inclined to think so. What a shame. Soon the updated Netflix access controls will kick me out. It feels almost a blessing in disguise.",6/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"Story line is awful and its so slow and boring I fell asleep on the first attempt to watch. On the second watch I couldn't finish the film.Actors did their best with what they had but I really can't recommend watching this. It attempted to make you guess the storyline with some very weak relationship build ups, but all it did was let me down.It has a cheap low budget feel to it and I really do think Netflix were relying on the big budget actors to make this film.It's a shame because with the line up it should have been a really good evening film for couples, but I wouldn't watch this again if you paid me.",3/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"The main flaw is the lack of chemistry been the two main characters, as others have said. This is undeniably true. It's hard to see why they would be friends at all, let alone prospective lovers. But even so, the film is perfectly watchable - and I've sat through many far ""better"" films which I've enjoyed less.The individual performances (I could happily watch Reece Witherspoon reading a telephone directory) are perfectly fine, and in a sense the movie is carried by its co-stars: Zoë Chao, Tig Notaro, Steve Zahn, Griffin Matthews. And there's a lot of fun to be had. The film also portrays very clean, orderly, almost antiseptic New York and Los Angeles which border on surreal.This film is like an after dinner coffee and chocolate; a relaxing, comfortable morsel but hardly main course stuff. I have no problems with easy watchable films, with a bit of humour thrown in. A ""great film"" it ain't; a pleasant way of whiling away an hour and a half it very much is.",7/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"2 out of 5 stars.Your Place or Mine is a bad romantic comedy film that not only is predictable with its plot but falls flat with the two main characters Reece Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher. There performances are flat with there characters. The chemistry is tedious. About two best friends switched places for a week. The story is forgettable. The acting is stale. It is a difficult romantic film to even care for the characters. I did find the film to be forgettable and boring. The script also was also lacking the development in putting any depths with the characters. Overall, it is one rom com that is worth skipping.",4/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"This was literally one of the worst films I've ever watched. How can reece wetherspoon still be so bad at acting after 25 years , and what's up with Aston Kutchers face. And why is there zero story and why is it so badly written and why was it made??? Who made it??? How much did they get paid cause whatever its was it was too much. Please stop making this crap I beg you. Why is reece wetherspoon always acting like a 19 year old silly girl, its embarrassing and stupid and offensive to the world and any other life out there! Not funny, not interesting, not anything. Save yourself and run! Do not watch.",3/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"The most average rom-com possible. Hallmark films have more life and originality. I found myself longing for a guy in flannel to sweep the lead of her feet. While those films have the same basic storyline at least they're entertaining.Vanilla ice cream is my favorite. Vanilla movies are not. Who doesn't like Reese Whitherspoon and Ashton Kutcher. But not in this dull, flat, lifeless film.Steve Zahn and Tig Notaro were wasted and those roles could've been played by no name up and coming actors to at least give someone new a shot.Perfectly generic. At least it had a good budget so the production value was nice. Good job with the LED volume scenes in New York.",5/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"I was eagerly awaiting this movie as I like both Reese and Ashton but it was quite a let-down. It was so boring, I fell asleep half-way through. As everybody before me has said, no chemistry no emotion which is the foundation of a rom-com. But tell me this, they are never together in any scene until the very last scene. Throughout the entire movie they only interact through phone across the country, so how does one display chemistry. It is the script that made the movie so boring. It could have been another Harry met Sally where long time friends discover the love after 20 years, but not here. And yes, Ashton does 'look' older, no more Michael Kelso sadly.",5/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"OK let's address the elephant in the room. Yes, there is zero chemistry between Kutcher and Witherspoon. But there isn't supposed to be. They are both unaware of each others' feelings. So there's bound not to be chemistry.It's predictable? Well yes, but only in as much you realise after a while they will end up together. But it is rarely the destination that matters, it's the journey that counts.Was it La La happy? Yes, it was very positive and upbeat and we all need a bit of that. But that's not a bad thing, a great romcom should be positive and upbeat.I think Witherspoon was fantastic and Kutchner was OK, and the film was fine and entertaining and light hearted and positive and happy ending. For me that's a success.",6/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"So my girlfriend wanted to watch it for Valentine's Day. This piece of sht made me break up with her. Not really because she hated it to. The ending was funny when Ashton had his big I love you speech. I thought he was punking Reese, but turns out that was actually the lines somebody wrote for a script. So that person sucks too.So with that said, I can't believe people listen to anyone in Hollywood on political issues when they write garbage like this. It's like having a kid give you some macaroni art and you then take that kids advice on life. Your art sucks. Your political views suck more.",1/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"Contains spoliersSo, the movie starts off very slow and boring and then is super rushed at the end. Both the main characters careers aren't explained it's not really a love story but is at the same time. Ashton doesn't realize that he's fallen in love with Reese until the last 30 minutes and at the end of the movie he's like ""I've been in love with you forever"" they aren't compatible and there isn't any chemistry. There are multiple jokes in the movie that don't really land. I think they were trying to make this a non predictable movie but we all know that they are going to fall in love at the end.",3/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"The film was a delightful and charming movie that left a smile on my face. The humor was well-timed and the story was cute and engaging. Ashton Kutcher and Reese Witherspoon both delivered strong performances, bringing their unique comedic styles to the film. However, despite their undeniable talent, there was no real spark or chemistry between the two lead actors. This lack of chemistry was a bit of a letdown as it detracted from the overall romantic atmosphere of the film. Nevertheless, it was still a fun and entertaining watch, with plenty of laugh-out-loud moments and heartwarming scenes. The supporting cast was also fantastic, adding depth and dimension to the story. Overall, the film was a fun and light-hearted movie that would make for a great date night or family movie. While it may not be the most memorable film, it's definitely worth watching for its light-hearted and charming atmosphere.",5/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"What a waste of good actors ... the movie is so boring and coming from someone that watches even Hallmark movies !Reese and Ashton have 0 chemistry !Whoever directed this movie should think about a new career choice.My stars are just for the kid Jack and the friend Mika , they were the ones that made this 2 hours of boredom watchable ...
And that end was sooo cheesy I can't even recommend this move to someone is going to watch while ironing !!There was such a hype about this movie when it was advertised that one could never imagined from the propaganda that this movie was this dull!Do better Netflix!",3/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"This new addition to the rom-coms with zero chemistry between the lead pair, started off pretty well to establish two best friends taking 2 decades (2hrs) to realise the love for each other. She has to visit New York for an accounting program, leaving her kid alone as her babysitter had other plans which prompts him to move all the way from New York to LA to babysit her kid. They leave no opportunity to remind they are best friends all the while.Rom-Coms have the tough task to sell the predictable story in the cheesiest manner, which is exactly this movie does. But for that to work, the lead pair had to have a spark. When the lead pair, Reese Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher, it is too obvious to not settle for anything less. Again, with all the split screen scenes between the two and even the mandatory airport showdown scene, this still lacked everything to make it a memorable watch.",3/10
Your Place or Mine (2023),"Actually looked forward to this film, the storyline sounded great.Reece Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher exchange apartments in New york and L A.Witherspoon is doing a course, while Kutcher looks after her 14 yr old son in L A. Debbie gets to learn all the things about Peter whilst staying in NYC, which gives her an idea how he has been living the past years, with his relationships etc, whilst Peter contends with all the issues looking after Jack, Debbie's son.After they had been in some sort of relationship 20 years ago, and have only been in touch only over the phone, I felt the film lost all navigation, someone you had not seen for all this time would come to L A, and look after your son ( who incidentally has all the allergies and requirements that required passing a housekeeping exam) , Debbie an extremely controlling mother, seemed it ok to leave him with Peter, someone she considered a childless womanizer, which was backed up by the arrival of Minka played by Zoe Chao.I guess there was some decent comedy which is why I gave it 4 stars and a very good cast to boot, but the whole swapping agenda story along with some of the sub-plots were terrible.",4/10
The Menu (2022),"This is a movie that plays on something everyone has come across in their lives: obsession. The movie starts out as a seemingly eerie thriller/suspense type movie with weird and unique quirks, but slowly devolves into something much more wild and very obviously takes it too far. With a script tighter than the meticulously crafted Chef's menu, even the most curmudgeon movie-goer will have their plates full with this one.I won't spoil anything with a synopsis, but rather try to intrigue anyone on the fence about seeing this movie.The Menu has something fresh and interesting to say about the tired conversation surrounding the marriage between art and artist. There are some very clearly illogical and confusing elements of the plot that you can easily miss if you're taking it at face value.Overall, this movie isn't meant to be a sensible, coherent and satisfying thriller. Instead, it's a comment on a poignant phenomenon in our society: the way we view, consume, pursue, and ultimately obsess over those who produce the art around us. Sure, the movie is about a chef and his meticulous menu, but in reality the larger point is about the production of any type of art, namely filmmaking.It seems to me that the filmmaker is making a very focused point about the state of movies nowadays. There seems to be a constant theme throughout about how often artist and their fans seem so detached from each other, even though their mutual approval of the art should be enough to bring them together.An absolutely bonkers second act and a considerably more bonkers third act wrap up what I believe to be a masterpiece commentary on the state of filmmaking in 2022. The only moneymakers are massive superhero movies, massive studio A++ list celebrity movies, etc, and the makers of this film ask one simple question:How long until we collectively call out their BS and ask for some simple bread?The movie makes you question how far you'd go into ""buying into the hype"", and conversely has a quite shocking commentary on those who consistently stay away from ""the hype"" without buying into it. Think of some of the ridiculous fashion trends that some of the highest brands in clothing perpetuate, and just how many people will blindly follow simply because there is an LV or GG stamp on it.It's no shock to me that a script with this kind of tonal shifting comes to us from the writers/directors of Succession. So much of the way this film is crafted reminds me of the show. Sharp wit, sarcasm that lies somewhere between funny and cringeworthy, twists, turns, and of course, the oh-so subtle thumbing of the nose at all the socially accepted, yet fundamentally insane reverence for brilliance that we hold dear.As a movie-lover, this was one of the more thought provoking pieces of the year. This movie makes you wonder what the line is between brilliant artist and insane psycho. The movie makes you look around and find yourself in the all the characters; the artist, the art, and those who are (literally) consuming it.All in all, this movie is an insightful parody of the state of not only the word of fine dining, but also fashion, art, filmmaking, music, etc. I might have a completely wrong reading of this movie, but hey, that's what art's about, right?",8/10
The Menu (2022),"From the start and the trailer, I think many will realize this is not a typical film. It means that you cannot watch it as a story narrative but understand it is a representation, a satire. And what is that satire?The premise of the film is about losing passion and purpose. The chef's suicidal tendency and the plot of the film was about losing his purpose, his joy and desire to fulfill that purpose. This was reflected also in his conversation with Margot, who also felt that way about her work. And once more with the actor, as the chef called him out as an actor who has lost his purpose.In the ending, Margot called him out. She said, the chef's one purpose, only purpose was to create food which a customer might enjoy. He failed. That was the whole premise and whole point of the film.Why did the chef fail? Because of the society's tendency to pressure, to please. When you try to please the impossible, you end up losing your purpose, joy, and desire. This is why chef invited these people, of all he blame as ""the ruin of his art, his life.""The ending is straight to the point. Margot did something the chef had been waiting for. She told the authentic truth. Everyone is afraid, they're afraid of the chef. Why? Because they're afraid of offending. Margot never liked the food from the start. She wanted to send it back, and was stopped by Tyler. In the end, at the face of death, she stood up and told the chef the truth, she did not like his food and she has the courage to send it back.When the chef asked her what she wanted to eat, she remembered the photo she saw in his room. The ONE time chef was ever smiling, back when he started it all as a greasy teen, back when he knew the joy of his purpose as a chef, to serve the food to the customers and not about pleasing status quo. She reminded him of that. Remember what he said towards the end? The pain was almost gone, almost. She took away his pain and reminded him the joy of cooking.---To sum up what is the point of the movie. The restaurant is America, what it has become today. It has become a nation bent on pleasing the unpleasable. The people no longer owns the nation, like the chef, but they are owned instead by wealthy ""angel investors."" And like the chef, including the rest of the staff, the joy and soul, the purpose of this nation has been eroded away.The cheeseburger. It represents the heart of America, what we use to be. Like chef cooking that cheeseburger, we remember the 1950s/60s... the joy and purpose of being an American. Remember, Margot specifically asked for ""American cheese"" and chef commented ""it is the best cheese because it melts without splitting."" The cheese is the constitution, is what binds us together as Americans... so we would not split... It is the cheese that makes a cheeseburger a ""cheese""burger.---The people in the restaurants represent various aspects of the nation.The young men: Young generation of ambitious go-getters, who only focuses on work and money. This is quite clearly expressed in their dialog.The old couple: They represent the old political generation who had taken everything for granted. This is why the server asked, ""how will you handle it, with right or left?"" Also noticed the husband is an ""old white male,"" but in this specific case he has a skinny blonde wife with shoulder length hair and dresses very old fashion. The server chose ""left"" hand and the chef mocked him as a ""donkey."" The final clue is what Margot revealed about him to the chef that ""rattled"" her. These are 4 pretty direct clues who they were specifically satiring.The movie star and assistant: They represent the washed out name dropping Hollywood, who chef said ""has lost their purpose.""The critic and her editor: They represent the media, which with their reviews can give rise or downfall to any restaurant, or as chef said, ""how many lives have you ruined?""The coast guard: Our federal agents like the FBI, CIA, etc... yet they are all part of the kitchen.Tyler: The ""know it all"" young college generation, who thinks they know how everything works with their head knowledge but has no life experience. In politics, they talk about how they think they can run the country better, but when really put to the test, they fail like Tyler in the kitchen. This is why his dish is called ""the BS.""Margot: As the chef said, ""the working class, the service providers,"" the no-nonsense people who just want a cheeseburger. Remember she said, ""imagine if a restaurant doing what it is actually designed to do, serve actual food.""---The bread scene:This is their version of the emperor's new clothes, everyone knew there was no bread, but they played along with the groupthink and pretended it was an actual dish. Margot was the only one who didn't buy into this and called it out there was no food. The young men acknowledged the dish, but wanted special treatment. When no one had bread, they used their names and positions trying to get bread.The ending:Margot re-established the server and customer relationship. She realized all along, from the 1st moment chef talked to her, what the chef was looking for. Remember she she wanted to send the food back before and also reminded Tyler that ""you're paying him to serve you.""The chef misplaced her as one of them, the servers. In context to the scene, she is not a server, but a ""customer."" This is why the last scene was pivotal, he outright said it to her, ""you are an eater."" This is what led to her revelation. Then standing up as a customer, she returned the menu and asked for a cheeseburger. The chef allowed her to leave when she wanted it to go because the customer is always right.This is a reminder that in this constitutional republic, our politicians work for us, the people. Like Margot, we need to re-establish and fix this relationship in order for the nation to survive. Otherwise, like everyone else in this restaurant who knew they were going to die but did very little to prevent their own demise, we are simply part of the menu. Chef actually brought out this point when the coast guard came.But even after Margot got out, they could've all did the same thing and asked for a cheeseburger. As the chef pointed out, they didn't try hard enough to fight back. It was as if they all had already accepted the menu. In the final scene, you can see some of them even thanking chef.Though some of them tried to escape, they didn't fight back. Margot fought back, against the menu, by sending it back and being authentic with herself and then with the chef.",10/10
The Menu (2022),"The hype for The Menu intrigued me. The reviews celebrated its genius. So I had to see it. And when I sat in the theater and the credits began to roll, all o could say was, ""Huh?"" The Menu starts with Ready or Not vibes with a fish-out-of-water real-world character who ends up at a fancy dinner with a collection of high society foodies and critics. The trailer gave me expectations of cannibalism cult or Most Dangerous Game-type plots, but instead, nothing really happened. I think I understood what The Menu was trying to convey with its deeper meaning, but I still came up disappointed. Anya Taylor-Joy and the rest of the cast gave great performances, but there was little that really brought the movie together. Maybe the subversion of the cannibal or hunting expectation was the movie's brilliance? The Menu definitely tried to be clever, but whether it was or not might be open to interpretation. Ironically, I sat through the whole movie and left wanting more... left hungry.",5/10
The Menu (2022),"This film was something else, I am genuinely stumped and at a loss for words. Mark Mylod (Director) Seth Reiss (Writer) and Will Tracey (Writer) all deserve a round of applause. They all together created something so unique.What set this film apart from other thriller, horrors are great performances and great writing. Every character here is well done and intelligently written. The entire cast gives great performances with Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy truly being the standouts as they playoff each other very well.Each character purposely reflected a personality type that if you ever worked in service you would encounter and come to know very well. To my fellow service employees you know what I'm talking about.What really stuck with me long after the credits have rolled is the commentary this film has on society. At it's core I believe this film to be about a Chef who's long career facing multitudes of people both customers and critics has affected his passion for his art. It's here where I also believe to be the film makers commentary on what it is to be an artist in this films case a Chef. It felt to me what the film makers are saying is as artists they pour their heart and souls into their art and craft both to serve and entertain us and as consumers it's very easy to lose appreciation for that hard work and effort.But I digress, perhaps I'm over thinking things and this film is not very deep as I seem to believe it is. Nonetheless this film was quite unique, thrilling, and entertaining. It's films like these that remind me of why I go to the theater and why I fell in love with storytelling and cinema.IMDb: 8/10

The Menu (2022),"Nice try, but the satire doesn't land in this film that skewers pretentious foodies and the chefs who cook for them.There's already been one satire this year that savages the rich, ""Triangle of Sadness,"" and that's a much better film than this one. I'm ok with an outlandish premise, but if you're going to give me one, then the rules within the world of the movie have to be consistent. In this film, characters act like they're in a realistic horror movie one minute and a goofy satire the next. The tone doesn't stick to one or the other, so what was probably intended to be cutting instead falls flat.The ending especially is silly. It definitely did not leave me wanting s'more.Grade: C+",6/10
The Menu (2022),"And that's all Folks, that's all you need to Know. The Premise was Better Than the Actual Execution of the Movie.Things I Did Like -1.

The Description and Pictures of the Different Dishes on screen was Great to See.3. The Anya Taylor Joy Character Reveal whilst talking to the Chef was Ok I guess.4. The Cop or Security Guy that Shows Up to Help was a Good Scene.5. I liked the Fact that the Chef Knew Exactly who everyone was and their History.

I get the Motivation for why the Chef is Doing what he is Doing to these People but it wasn't Executed with any Interest in these Characters.2. After the First Half, the Mood changed because the Characters Sort of Knew where this was heading and I didn't like that tone whatsoever, it was kind of like seriousness with a joky overtone and it didn't work for me.3.

There is a pointless albeit a sort of funny to watch ""Activity"" that happens in the Movie. But it was Pointless.5. At the End, When Anya Taylor Joy gives the Chef a ""Change of Heart"", I thought it was a great idea however once again, it wasn't Executed profoundly, it was Dull.6. The Final, Final end Bit, some of the Characters actually start Believing what this Chef is saying and agreeing with him, ""Like Really?""Overall, The Premise was Far Better than the Execution.",6/10
The Menu (2022),"I waited months for this film thinking it would be so much better than it was. There is nothing quite like the let down of expecting something great, and it turning out to be mediocre at best.While the plot is pretty original (which normally scores high points with me) and while the film is at times quite beautiful to look at, it altogether missed the main point of a good meal: gratification.Scares are not included on the menu; comedic value is barely there; it is unsatisfyingly light on gore; hints of interesting dialogue exist, but they are scantily peppered throughout; the characters as well as their backstories, are as distinctly unpalatable, as are their intentions nondescript; it wore on and became progressively less, instead of more enjoyable; and the main course was both 'cheesy' and less than fulfilling. By the time dessert was to be served, the previous dishes laid still undigested and leaden.I'd like to speak to the manager, please.",6/10
The Menu (2022),This looked like an interesting film based on the trailer and the first half of it was just that. The tension and suspense was building nicely. There were little dribs and drabs and hints of what might be coming without being too obvious. The acting from everyone in the film was good. Even supporting characters with only a few lines. Were well realized I remember thinking that I couldn't wait to see where it was all going.Sadly it didn't really go anywhere. It all unwound in the second half. The acting was still on but the writing failed. That's the most i can say without giving up any spoilers. And that was extra disappointing because the first half was so good. This Menu did not deliver the meal as advertised.,4/10
The Menu (2022),"The Menu isn't the first to satirise the rich and their incompetence and isn't saying anything new but that definitely doesn't prevent it from being a great satire that pokes fun at everything it can in ways that are often consistently funny, playful and extremely stylish.Ralph Fiennes gives a terrific performance full of awkward unease that only enhances his commanding screen presence. Anya Taylor-Joy is a perfect audience surrogate amongst a sea of deliberately unlikeable characters of which the best is Nicholas Hoult whose almost too good at making his character hilariously pathetic.Mark Mylod's direction is excellent, the film has more than enough visual style to match the pretentiousness of its characters and is really good at building tension. The music by Colin Stetson is fantastic, striking a unusual balance between beautiful and unnerving.",8/10
The Menu (2022),"""The Menu"" offers a trailer spectacular enough to entice me to set foot in a physical movie theater for the first time in 3 years. Packed with both veteran and burgeoning actors and directed by Mark Mylod of ""Succession"" fame, this movie has all the goodies to entertain you and make you think at the same time, supposedly. It starts out well enough, introducing quirky mysterious characters starting with Elsa played by Hong Chau. I find her really captivating in this role, a perfect combo of politeness and menace. Why is she dressed like that? Then we meet the Chef who has an agenda that unravels through the perspective of Margot, played by the always-awesome Anya Taylor-Joy. Margot is us, wanting to expose the ridiculousness of it all. Yet herein lies the problem with the movie. Its effort as a biting satire turns into a confusing mess at the end. ""The Menu"" could have given us something to chew on, instead I walk out of the movie theater scratching my head.",6/10
The Menu (2022),"The Menu is a real treat. It will have you laughing while on the edge of your seat as it navigates you through a restaurant experience to remember.We are treated to a fantastic ensemble cast. Nicholas Hoult steals the show with a pitch perfect performance of a pretentious foodie. Fiennes is so wonderfully unhinged as the mysterious creator of the eponymous menu in a very layered role. Anya Taylor Joy as always is so watchable, providing such an easy way in for the audience. The writing gives them all such brilliant material which the whole cast executes with ease.The style and staging of the piece can't be faulted at all. It is precise, inventive, and so clean and polished which makes for a very visually appealing film.It must be said there are a few rough edges when it comes to the plot, and when you get down to the nuts and bolts the premise isn't necessarily groundbreaking. It is very on the nose at times and subtlety isn't exactly it's strong suit. However it manages to strike a well tuned balance between satire, comedy, and thriller which isn't an easy feat and is impressively managed here.With its sharp social observations and satire, clean style, and stellar performances, the Menu is a feast that you won't want to end.",8/10
The Menu (2022),"I saw all the glowing reviews for this movie, so I was expecting a winner. But this menu lacked flavor.Problems with this movie: Nobody you cared about; why did Chef decide to do this final menu; why did everyone believe in his cause; how were these people who came that 'bad' or deserving of their fate; why would he tell at least one of them what he was planning; and what was the point of setting up a fake coast guard, how did he know that would even be needed; what was the point of having his mother there; how does the protagonist not only figure out how to start up the boat but also pilot it in the dark.The movie had good pacing, but the direction this film was going, even who would survive in the end, was way too obvious early on. A shame that so many great actors were somewhat wasted in this film.",3/10
The Menu (2022),"If you are an avid film watcher and want your intelligence insulted by a story depicting a bunch decent actors playing very inept roles as guest to dine at a remote island restaurant hosted by a sadistic chef to then be massacre without fighting back at all, then have at it. I mean this was absolutely appalling to watch. You really want me to believe that I'm trapped on a island defenseless against a bunch of cooks? That there is no way to defend myself is anyway with a bunch of utensils all around? Seriously? That I'm so supposed to just accept my fate at the hand of dimwits based off a nonsensical menu to only become part of the menu? Really? And that's the story premise I kid you not. No matter many hype reviews have been posted, This was just one dumb film.",2/10
The Menu (2022),"'The Menu' received widespread acclaim, and honestly I can't fathom why. The film is just as pretentious as gourmet cooking.So, twelve guests attend an executive, very, very expensive dinner on an island. All of them were personally invited by Chef Slowik. On arrival, the maître d'hôtel Elsa noticed Tyler (Nicholas Hoult) did not bring his original date. With him is Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy) who - as it turns out - was hired to accompany him. This little detail will play a big part later.The rest of the film is set almost entirely in the restaurant, as we watch the specially selected menu being served - gourmet cooking at its best. Exquisite dishes are being served, impeccably garnished to perfection. (Personally, I've never been one for gourmet food. I want FOOD, not samples thereof...)We soon realize there is something sinister about the chef. This is one of those films where saying too much will result in spoilers. All I'm going to say, is that even after a person gets killed in view of everyone, they continue serving and the guest continue to saviour their food. And even towards the end they STILL have an appetite and comment on how delicious the food is - after everything that's happened...!!!! I shook my head in disbelief thinking ""what the bloody hell is wrong with these people..."".As the film developed, it became weirder and weirder. Just weird. There were a few character twists, but as a whole the movie just wasn't entertaining. Oh, and the Tyler character was a real idiot and the most unlikeable character. Very little to nothing is told why the victims deserved their fate. This film made absolutely no sense whatsoever.Despite all the fancy trimmings, by the end all I wanted was a plain ole cheese burger (figuratively speaking, off course). I wanted something with substance, and not merely hints of something promising (hmm, just like gourmet food...)Had 'The Menu' not been given a substantial budget with a stellar cast, this could easily have ended up being a bad B-movie. By the time the film ended, it felt like a complete waste of time for this highly overrated film. 'The Menu' did not satisfy my palette. I can't recommend this.Would I watch it again? No! I want a cheese burger...with fries.",3/10
The Menu (2022),"Mark Mylod's ""The Menu"" is clearly a satire of a great many things--class, snobbishness, obsession, and the eating experience-in-general immediately spring to mind. While it certainly gets some awkward laughs and throws enough bizarre sight/character gags to live up to that satire moniker, it does so without one coherent, over-arcing message or a single character to really root for.For a very basic overview, ""The Menu"" follows Tyler (Nicholas Hoult) and Margot (Anya Taylor-Joy) as they embark on a lavish/expensive dining experience coordinated by master chef Slowik (Ralph Fiennes). As the courses progress and some weirdness--which quickly becomes deadly-serious--pop ups, it becomes apparent that this ""fine dining"" is anything but.To me, the glaring problem with ""The Menu"" was that it lacked any character I could really root for amidst the bizarre nature of the circumstances they are placed in. It certainly isn't the Chef himself or any of the other pretentious passengers, and clearly the protagonist is supposed to be Taylor-Joy's Margot. But even that character is difficult to root for in the beginning and suffers from some thematic irregularity as more about her is revealed. As such, it was difficult for me to become invested in this film when I couldn't find a ""way in"".I also believe that ""The Menu"" is very much a ""throw a bunch of themes at the wall to see what sticks"" sort of movie. There are a number of undercurrents running through the picture, but they are largely dangled in front of the audience before quickly moving on to the next one. There is no overall take-home message or thoroughfare to be found here.I can give ""The Menu"" 3-stars for at least being a competent production from a visual/tonal standpoint--but no more. Even if one accepts the spattering of ideas that constitute its plot, it may be difficult to find something (or someone) to make you truly care one way or another.",3/10
The Menu (2022),"Mark Mylod's ""The Menu"" is a tasteful treat that manages to be gripping, satirical, jarring, and hauntingly brilliant. The film is a great social commentary on class values and class systems. It gives audiences an adrenaline rush that makes for an exciting and wild viewing experience. The film is filled with twists and turns and keeps the viewer guessing till the credits roll. Apart from its rich screenplay and magnificent production design, the film also benefits from having a star-studded cast. Ralph Fiennes as the stern and conservative Chef Slovik is the obvious standout, but Anya Taylor-Joy as Margot aka Erin brings something different to the table (literally). Nicholas Hoult as Tyler perfectly brings this rather douchey and self-obsessed character to life. I went in completely blind, not having watched the trailer and avoided any marketing for the movie, and I'm glad that I did. Everyone should experience this movie by themselves and to not let anyone influence their opinion. I wouldn't be surprised if the movie nabs Oscar nominations for best production design and best screenplay. Mark Mylod fully utilized his creative outlet and managed to craft something peculiar, unfamiliar, and delightful.Final verdict: 9.5/10.",9/10
The Menu (2022),"The 2 points are for the acting from some of the side characters and a couple of ""margos"" scenes.But the chef & about a boy man, were just awful. The ""storyline"" was just awful. No real understanding of why all these people suddenly decided to do a mass murder/suicide.Killing innocent (though annoying) people, after obviously being just good chefs. And then everyone just getting their credit cards out and then sitting there with marshmallows on their bodies, waiting to die.Get the h up and move. Just ridiculous. The attempts to escape were pathetic. Yeah they were out numbered but get up and fight, dont just accept it, you are going to die anyway, so try something, take someone out etc.And then the cheeseburger. Please.",2/10
The Menu (2022),"So, having only seen a brief preview of this & reading briefly what this was about I wasn't entirely sure what to expect. It was a horror/comedy type film so that is the reason why I went in to see this.The film sees a young couple who travel to a Remote Island to eat at an exclusive restaurant where the Chef has prepared a lavish & interesting menu. Though as soon as they arrive there, things are not all they seem & the food the Chef brings out makes the couple & everyone else question what is really going on as a sinister feeling starts to boil...!I found the film to be not the greatest. I mean, the first half is great & suspenseful & really keeps you guessing as to what is going to happen next. It really entices you in as there doesn't appear to be anything to make you think something obviously bad is going to happen. So, for the first half it's great, but...The second half is a let down. The film goes completely off the rails, the story itself & its narrative are as clear as mud & there's so many unanswered questions, plot holes & things that happen that go against the main antagonists rules. The ending was just bad also & just plain lazy & too straight forward for a film like this one.The action we did get, the gore & shocking violence were great, but couldn't save this dish, sadly. There's some humour to be had in this film which was good, but again, couldn't salvage this feast even if it wanted to.The film does somewhat drag & the runtime is 100 minutes too long (1 hour & 40 minutes). I also felt the narrative & story arc of the film wasn't clear enough & the ending was totally unsatisfactory. The cast, however, were great. The characters were ok, but the main female lead was pretty unlikable. Chef Slowik was good though.Overall, it's a pretty out there film. Not the greatest & has a clear as mud plot with other elements not aiding in the understanding. The characters are ok, but weak with the except of Chef Slowik, the main antagonist Margo wasn't likable & pretty obnoxious. The films story arc & ending made no sense & had 0 explanation by the final act with a dragged out pacing & runtime. While there was some funny parts & some action/gore, it couldn't save this dish that I would like to take back.4/10.",4/10
The Menu (2022),"Dark humor and satire are mostly very satisfying. But in The Menu it didn't go as well as it started. The beginning is actually very good. I was completely enchanted. The cinematography and acting is stunning. But somewhere in the middle something went very wrong. So wrong that you don't understand what's going on. And that's exactly where The Menu fails. Too many awkward and crazy things happen and no one seemed to care, and that's also when I realized that The Menu is actually a very pointless and empty dark satire with no real punchline. Only snobbish film critics will love this ""masterpiece"". Real people who prefer a cheeseburger to snobbish food will hate it. Giving it one star to offset the high rating the film doesn't deserve.",1/10
The Menu (2022),"Zero point to the entire length of this artsy mess. A bunch of stars stuffed into a room on an island. No twist. No plot line. A bunch of lame recipes served as acts in a play.Summary: idiots stuck in room don't fight back eventually burn up as s'mores. Yep, s'mores. After we get to watch the lady actor with huge eyes pretend to devour a cheeseburger.I feel like this film was pitched to a room of people dosed with some heavy meds and then asked if they dig it or not. The room replied: I dig it.This is a stunt you'd typically see on Netflix. This somehow was approved without that checkbox.I have really nothing great to say about this. I guess I could comment it was shot well in some studio full of actors that need attention. If you're into that then waste your life like I did.",3/10
The Menu (2022),"Eloquent and beautifully made but not for me, hence no rating. I understand the couple reviews with high ratings, I see where they're coming from but I won't be coming from there. You know when someone tells you a story and it's a nothing story, nothing good nothing bad; like when someone tells you ""hey, I went for a walk at the park"" and you're just like 'oh okay'. I left the cinema and all I felt was ""oh, okay"".So it was hard for me to form concrete opinions on this because it didn't leave an impact on me. I had no idea what this was about heading in, not even the genre, all I knew was the cast of which was an alluring lineup and they did a great job. I was confused for the first hour, seemed all over the place and wondering where the movie was going. I just thought maybe it'll all make sense in the end.Once things take a turn or the things kick off per say, I thought 'well then it's a thriller', but it never really gets there. There is some action, it's spread far apart so it doesn't feel thrilling, and once the plot is revealed you pretty much know how the rest of the movie will go and when precisely the next big thing will happen as an order is established to it, so zero suspense after that as well.It's like an ostentatious slasher film, classy. Actually I'll describe it the same way I feel about Michelin star or fancy restaurants; you get there and order off the menu in French even though you don't speak it and when they serve you your order it's on a baroque plate with a tiny but beautiful piece of meat with a mint leaf on top and dazzle of chocolate or something. It's fancy, has all these rare ethically produced ingredients and served with wine thrice your age but you'd really rather just have a meaty McDonald's burger with cola that will actually fill you up instead. And that's me, I'd really rather just have a mindless, barbaric slasher movie. I can appreciate this, it was visually stunning and probably mouth watering for some but but my brain is a hardwired, simple minded layman's.If halfway through the movie, the kitchen staff started chasing after the guests in the movie, some sick hide and seek then kill game, stuck on an island generic plot line I might have enjoyed it better. The kitchen staff do begin to shift from impressive conduct to a cult like behavior as the night goes, but it never gets slasher-ish, it maintains this high class fiendish aura instead. An example of a movie that sorta blended the two, with less sophistication of course, was Midsommer. So, if you want that 5 star $3000 Michelin dinner/horror movie here it is... but if you want some pizza, grilled cheese or whatever poor man's junk food gory horror, then this isn't for you.It plays out in real time, in an attempt to immerse you in the experience I presume. It is one of the more original plots and movie settings I've seen this year, just unfortunately doesn't feel that groundbreaking. It's very deliberate, feels like every detail in the movie is exactly how the director wanted it to be, so can't say it there were things the movie could've done better. It's a really well made movie, it just didn't leave an impact on me, and I don't know if it was meant to. It's like they made a movie just because they wanted to, but the still wanted it to be good so everything is daintily done. It also lacks depth, both in characters and story; the high class slander felt too evident and cheap without it.Here are some bullet form thoughts I had as I was watching(spoiler-ish):
-in a gender role reversal, we have a boyfriend, not girlfriend, who takes photos of everything he eats for instagram and hates it when you touch it before he does so
-if you hate rich people and wanna see them scared here's a movie for you
-If I paid $1250 each for my date and I's dinner, just to be served tiny leaves on an actual stone I'd lose it
-Tyler was such a d* rider
-Slowik doesn't like s'mores, he's just like me for realAnyway, I don't want to call the finale underwhelming as it was it felt in line with everything else. And I don't want to give a rating because if someone gave it a 3 and another person a 7/10.... I wouldn't argue with either of them.In consonance with it's tag line, the movie is indeed painstakingly prepared, brilliant execution... of a dull story. Back to my analogy, sure some fancy Italian cusine sounds and looks great, but I'd rather just eat a pizza. As someone once said; chicken over duck, steak over lamb, salmon over caviar, rice over risotto. And this movie is risotto not rice.",3/10
The Menu (2022),"A group of people are invited to spend an evening with the renowned chef Chef Slowik at his Island restaurant, an uneasy, uncomfortable evening begins.Wow, one or the most original, creative and thought provoking films for quite a while, the most original movie of 2022. I wasn't sure quite what to expect, and even as the film progressed, I had no idea what it was going to develop into, and where it was heading, such was the originality.Terrific visuals, it was beautifully shot, very well filmed, I loved the symmetry and imagery, it looked great.Ralph Fiennes never disappoints, and he gave a masterclass here as Slowik, some wonderfully intense scenes, he commanded attention. Considering the number of Brits playing Americans, I had no issues with the accents, they all did a fine job, I really enjoyed watching Nicholas Hoult also.Proof that there is still originality in cinema, 9/10.",9/10
The Menu (2022),"Maybe I'm just not snobby enough, or maybe I expect to be entertained when I pay the kind of money that movies cost today!! On both accounts, I feel totally ripped off!!!I suppose the message was making fun of rich/eccentric idiots? I don't know, someone is going to have to explain WTF I just saw. It was horrible! When I saw the trailer, I couldn't figure out how they'd make a 2 hour movie from simply eating dinner - my initial instincts were correct - YOU CAN'T!! With the exception of a few laughable scenes, overall it was painfully slow, boring and void of any interesting plot or characters. I would have walked out, if I hadn't agreed to go with a friend.RECOMMENDATION: Skip it! I'd rather watch paint dry....",3/10
The Menu (2022),"The Menu is probably the most unpredictable movie I've seen in a while. This thriller is filled tension and super dark comedy moments and it's wonderfully carried by the amazing, Anya-Taylor Joy, the charismatic, Nicholas Hoult, the menacing, Ralph Fiennes, and the rest of the cast as well (one of the best ensembles in a film of the year). Overall, this is a brilliant satire on the food industry and class warfare. This film is (pun intended) chef's kiss!Also little tangent, Nicholas Hoult was up against Robert Pattinson for The Batman and after watching The Menu I really wish Nicholas gotten the part because he gave a lot of Bruce Wayne energy here.",9/10
The Menu (2022),"One of the most absurd movie I've seen in a while. Some sort of jaded crazy vilain who think he's better than anyone in this world, extremely moralizing and think he's a god who can decide who deserve to die or not (depending if they respect food or not lol ok).This could be somewhat credible if only the main vilain was crazy and in some sort of psychosis, but EVERY one in his crew is as crazy as him. Some ingredient poison in the food who control them, something? Nah, they're just as crazy. Everyone. No one ever say ''hey maybe it's a bit awkward to follow this dude who like to kill everyone and want to kill us all''. EVERYONE is weird.The actor deserve to die because ''I watched one of your movie and it was awful so you must die'' uh ok.Very pretentious, endless awkward moralizing speechs between each food.The guy say that people will all die, but no one in the whole movie really try to do anything. Hey, you gonna die burned, try to fight, try to kill one? You will die anyway! ''Nah, let's just sit and eat, and wait.''Whole movie was weird, and I usually like weird movie because it make sense at some point. This one was weird but not in a good way. Boring, repetitive, just a main vilain who control everything from the beginning to the end, blabla-ing why he hate all of his clients and these ones should die (hey do you remember the menu last time? No? You deserve to die!!) Wow sorry I forgot stuff sometime, your food is not 100% of my life.The kitchen and food industry is tough and sometime your clients are very mean! So you will die!Seriously lolBad and embarassing movie. I think I will not trust IMDB anymore for the notes.",4/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"I did not expect the sequel to a decent spin-off Dreamworks film from over a decade ago to be one of the most poignant, introspective, genuinely hilarious, and heartwarming films of the year. But here we are.After an overly cheesy, somewhat clunky opening sequence, The Last Wish very quickly begins developing its zany assortment of characters into distinct quirky personalities with sympathetic desires and clear goals. The film juggles several character arcs and it's almost miraculous how it successfully handled all of them with proper set up and satisfying, emotionally weighty payoffs.The screenplay is wacky, witty, and also bursting with heart as it deals with weighty themes of trusting others and finding purpose in any circumstances. And it tackles these themes in ways that are always understandable to all ages but never insultingly oversimplified.What I also didn't expect was that the action sequences would be so well-choreographed and beautifully animated, and that the movie would often be terrifying and violent at times.I adored this film. I think it's Dreamworks' best film since Megamind and it's easily the best true family film of the year.",10/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is as spry and light on its feet as its titular feline. The inherently alluring paradox of the swashbuckling kitty from the ""Shrek"" universe remains firmly in place 11 years after his first solo feature. He's a dashing adventurer, a charmer with the ladies, feared and renowned throughout the land -- but he's also unbearably adorable as he laps up milk from a shot glass with his pinky, sandpapery tongue. As always, the charismatic and sensitive Antonio Banderas finds just the right tone in exploring this furry animated figure's suave and silly sides. ""The Last Wish"" expands the roster of ridiculously talented supporting players from the Oscar-nominated 2011 original ""Puss in Boots."" Joining Banderas and his longtime friend and co-star Salma Hayek Pinault are Florence Pugh, Olivia Colman, Ray Winstone, Da'Vine Joy Randolph, and John Mulaney, among many others. They bring a surprising amount of substance to what might have been a purely playful endeavor. But of course, the fast-paced humor and elaborate visuals are the main draws of director Joel Crawford and co-director Januel Mercado's film. The film's aesthetics may rely too heavily on anime influences, especially during the action sequences, but the vibrant colors and rich textures are a delight. From the moss growing on a fearsome forest giant to the shiny silkiness of Puss' whiskers blowing in the wind, ""The Last Wish"" offers a variety of eye-popping details. And it frequently features dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves to transition from past to present or one scene to the next. But the film also manages to convey messages of selflessness and teamwork in a way that doesn't feel heavy-handed or cloying. And the stellar voice performances and dazzling visuals keep things so engaging you won't need a laser pointer or a catnip-stuffed mouse toy to entertain you.",10/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"SCORE: 9.5/10Puss in Boots has returned! I absolutely love movies that stick to what they are good at and don't try to overextend story lines that aren't very good. Every part of the story had its place and I didn't feel like they spent too much time on one specific part, with the exception of the main story of all the characters chasing after the Last Wish. Doug still holds the place for cutest animated dog in a movie, but Perrito was definitely giving him a run for his money. He was so pure and cute, and his dialogue was always perfectly timed. The scene with the bleeps when he gets kidnapped by Goldi and the Three Bears was hilarious and him putting his head on Puss' chest, acting as his therapy dog, was one of the cutest things I've ever seen.Death was one of the coolest animated villains I've seen. The animation style was perfect for the action scenes and his appearances were always epic. The Ethical Bug bit was also very funny and the humor in general was great. The ending was awesome, with the rest of the crew teaming up to take down Jack Horner and realizing they already all they could ever wish for. Goldi had her family and Puss had his one life worth living. Gotta love the Gingy and Pinocchio cameos, as well as them sailing off to Far Far Away to ""catch up with some friends"". This movie was a lot better than I was expecting. It was such a fun adventure and I really liked all the characters that were introduced along the way! It was just right.",10/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"Puss and Boots the last wish is a fantastic sequel and inarguably better than the charming first outing. The animation is brilliant, characters are charming, pacing is tight, very funny and the action is excellent. Not to mention there is a ton of heart. If I were to nitpick I think one of the antagonists trumps the other. One is played for more comedic purposes while the other is an Intimidating physical presence for boots to contend with. The Last Wish has something for everyone and it's probably one of the better animated movies I've seen in sometime. I really don't want to get into the story to avoid spoilers because the movie was a lot of fun, and it's best to go into it fresh. If anyone is considering taking their family to see the Last Wish like I did then The Last Wish is an easy recommendation. 100% worth the money. Two thumbs up for team friendship.",9/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"The last ""Puss In Boots"" movie was made 11 years ago, as well as the last film the ""Shrek"" franchise, so surely they couldn't make something really great again, right? The story is pretty standard, as Puss In Boots is down to his last life and tries to get a wish on a magic star. It seriously has some of the best action I've seen in a long time. I don't even think this film qualifies as a comedy. It really is more like a straightforward action flick. Even its first five minutes are nothing but nonstop action from Frame 1 to Frame...whatever.This film does not take place before the Shrek films. We get to see some brief flashbacks with Shrek himself, albeit only for a few seconds. The villains are Big Jack Horner, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, and a wolf. I believe a poster called this character the Big Bad Wolf, but he isn't that, even if he's technically based on him (he's actually DEATH). Every one of these villains are unique with their own motivations. Every minute makes me eager to find out what happens next.So...who does get the wish in the end? Nobody! Everyone (except Big Jack Horner) realizes they had what they wanted after awhile. It even begins with another sequel hook with Puss In Boots going back to Far Far Away Land. Another Shrek/Puss In Boots movie? If it has such amazing cel shading animation with the best CGI of all, it deserves as many films as possible! ****",10/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) becomes a popular folk hero in his country. After his latest conquest of a giant monster, he was killed by a freak accident with a church bell. When he woke up, Puss realized that he already spent eight of his nine lives, and that he only had one more life to live. At first he did not think it was a big deal, but a traumatic encounter with a sinister-looking Wolf (Wagner Moura) made Puss decide to retire from adventures.While living the life of a spoiled lazy lap cat, Puss learned about a Wishing Star from the family of Goldilocks (Florence Pugh) and the Three Bears (Ray Winstone, Olivia Colman and Samson Kayo) who were looking for it. Puss decided to search for the Star himself in order to wish for his nine lives back. Along with Puss on his quest were his old flame Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) and a nameless little orphan therapy dog (Harvey Guillen).This sequel to the first ""Puss in Boots"" solo spin-off movie came out 11 years after the original. There is a very evident difference that can be noted in the style of its animation. On top of the 3D computer-generated images of the characters, there is now an additional 2D artistic style as if they were hand-painted (first seen in ""The Bad Guys""), especially noted most prominently in the character of the Wolf, and even in Puss during their showdown fight scenes.The voice work of the actors really captured the personalities of the characters. Antonio Banderas's voice had the bravado, arrogance and charisma of Puss, whom we've known and loved since he made his first appearance in ""Shrek 2"" (2004). Selma Hayek lends her sexy sassiness to the voice of the skillful thief Kitty Softpaws, who held a grudge against Puss. Florence Pugh's characteristic raspiness was easily recognizable in Goldilocks's voice.Like before, the characters Puss encounters were all fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters. The choice for main antagonist was Jack Horner, the boy who sat in the corner eating his pies, but he was not little here anymore. He was not as famous as others, so some kids may need a review of his rhyme to refamiliarize. There were a trove of Disney character references you'll have fun identifying, from Mary Poppins, Alice in Wonderland and Jiminy Cricket.Very notable in this latest Dreamworks release is the darkness of the plot, which was also reflected in the artwork styles and situations depicted. Only in trickles, but this must be the first time blood was seen in a Dreamworks animated film. The language and humor used was also more mature, even with some assumed expletives bleeped out. As the topic of death played a major part in the story, scenes with the Wolf can be very scary for little kids. 8/10.PS: The new DreamWorks Animation opening logo precedes this film. It was quite nostalgic to see the DreamWorks boy seeing famous DreamWorks characters old an new -- like Toothless, Po, Boss Baby, a Troll, the Bad Guys and of course, Shrek with Fiona and Donkey -- as his crescent moon flew him around in space before settling in its place.",8/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"I did not have many expectations going into this with my daughter, I've seen the main Shrek movies but noon of the other Puss in Boot's spin-offs. I was shocked at how good a movie this was when the credits rolled!The story itself is functional, but all characters are given meaningful and relatable arcs. Between the melanchonic Puss reaching the end of his days as a great hero, his always positive dog sidekick and the 3 antagonistic parties trying to reach the magical macguffin there is a lot going on and none of it feels forced in.The two greatest assets the movie brings is it's humor and the stunning action scenes. First of all, this movie has bite, it is back to the tone of the first Shrek movie with lots of jokes that are working on a children and adult level of understanding. While the story is easy to follow for kids, the themes explored are relatively mature and will keep adults engaged.Secondly, while Disney/Pixar movies lately fail to make action exiting with their polished CGI style, Puss in boots goes full Into the Spiderverse once a fight breaks out. Glorious 12 frames per second, hyper stylized with all the filters and gimmicks necessary to elevate the big set-pieces to something truly special and memorable. Especially Puss's duels against a mysterious bounty hunter are the highlights.While not entirely original, the Puss in Boots: The Last Wish combines the edgy humor of Shrek with the visual wonders of Into the Spiderverse and strings it along a relatively matured heroes journey coming to it's end tale that is closer to Logan than any other animation I can think off. Oh and just in case (not that I personally care much about it) there is zero political agenda to be found here to be a distraction of the perception.",9/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"I was not at all interested in watching this film. As most of the animated movies from the major studios, especially from DreamWorks have been extremely dull and very samey. I can't think of a good one that I've seen since How To Train Your Dragon 2.But then I read all of the brilliant reviews and decided to give this one a go. And to my surprise, it was definitely a welcome change.Puss gets an existential crises when Death (AKA the Big Bad Wolf) comes for his last life after Puss has frivolously wasted his 8 other ones. It's interesting how dark it gets in these scenes, with Puss, who has never been afraid of death, gets scared and has a wakeup call. And learns to value life and the lives of others a bit more.Although it doesn't go as far as I thought it would when it came to heavy themes and character development, it certainly reminded me of the good old days of DreamWorks animation. So I absolutely consider this film a step in the right direction for this studio.",8/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"This is genuinely one of my favorite films of the year. I hope it gets real recognition and people don't dismiss it as ""just an animated film"".I've always liked DreamWorks films, with my favorite being How to Train Your Dragon 2, but after rewatching the first Puss in Boots movie, I wasn't expecting much for this sequel, eleven years after. I like the first installment for sure but it's certainly a lot simpler in story than I'd prefer. This one however, has such a rich emotional aspect to it that I truly felt something during it.There were also certain scenes involving a wolf character that were quite creepy. I think kids will have a lot of fun with this movie, but at the core this is a story about family and understanding the value of things and/or people who are in front of you already. And that's a message that every person of any age can get something out of. The voice acting is top-notch and the animation is such a ridiculous step-up from the last time. This is such a cool direction to take this sequel into and I dug it all the way through.There's really not much negative to say other than the ending feels like it should have been slightly more concise, but that's it. I loved it and I'll rewatch it as soon as it releases on VOD.",8/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"Seems that these days all the animated kids movies are more or less the same, with very few exceptions in recent years and it's grown tiresome. It's always potty humor and/or a weak storyline that either has adults rolling their eyes or falling asleep. This is one of the exceptions.With pitch perfect voice acting from all parts of the cast, to the way it makes old story concepts feel relatively fresh and funny again, this one is a winner. Best of all was the film doesn't rely on low brow, toilet humor to sell it's laughs. My favorite of which came from a certain play on Jiminy Cricket that I'm sure will have you in stitches.The animation had me a bit underwhelmed which is why I deduct a star, but that is subjective, so I leave that bit up to the viewer to decide for themselves. For me, when the action gets going, it felt glitchy and incomplete, but some people might enjoy that style.Overall, I highly recommend this one when it releases later this month. It's definitely a film that both kids and parents will find entertaining and enjoyable. I know I enjoyed it.4.5 retired heros out of 5.",9/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"I genuinely cannot believe I'm saying this, but this is one of the best movies of the year, so far, it's neck to neck with The Menu for me.Incredible on every front.The animation is incredible. I'm beyond thrilled that Dreamworks decided to ditch the hyper-realistic animation style, and just went for a style that would perfectly represent the emotions and craziness that this movie needed.The characters, EVERY SINGLE ONE, was so fleshed out, and they all felt like they had a purpose being there. We didn't get the usual Shrek style, Grimm fairytale cameos for no reason, on the contrary, they all played an important role in the story, and in the overall message.This movie also had me so emotional, no spoilers, but it's the way the creators handle their characters, with such sincerity and heart.Finally, the action, and the plot itself, it was go go go from the get go, i haven't seen a more well paced film all year, i think that is my favourite part of the dilm (Avatar 2 could take some notes)Overall, it was truly such a blast, so fun, heartfelt, FUNNY, genuine, with a great message at its core.",10/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"FYI, surprisingly, kids understood jokes aimed at adults. Yes, there are spots of the movies where it's hard to know what they understand because ideas aim at us adults. But, I think the kids still understood it enjoyed the deeper parts.Personally, the movie was very fitting. Like Puss, I'm also trying to find out who I am and who I want to be in life. This was our journey.The stories have great connections romantically, between rivals and newcomers. The stories are about bringing all of us together despite what happened in the past. The stories come together about building a better future for ALL OF US. Let go of selfish wants and desires, focus on OTHERS and let's work together for a better future!",9/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"Alright I know what you're thinking after seeing the score of this review. ""Sequels to spin-offs of beloved franchises are pointless exercises in brand awareness! Why on earth are you giving this one a 10?!?""Because this movie...is DIFFERENT than the others. Different in that it strives to be a funnier, deeper, prettier, bolder, edgier, (surprisingly) scarier and overall more complete experience than the original Puss in Boots film over 11 years ago, and unlike that movie holds a distinct accomplishment in simply being a darn fine animated film that stands on its own, one as good as any I've seen in the past few years.The Shrekiverse is officially back, and judging by what DreamWorks managed to pull off here the world probably isn't ready for whatever comes next. Seriously, this gives the first two films in the franchise alone a run for their money.Looks like The House That Shrek Built is finally back on top again.PS: That cricket with the spot-on Jimmy Stewart voice is one of the funniest things I've seen this year, whoever came up with him deserves a pay raise and a medal and free coffee and recognition from the United Nations.",10/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish provides a fun adventure with meaningful lessons and tons of vibrant action. Donde está la Leche?The first 30 minutes of the movie are filled with your typical Puss as he sings, dances, and fights with his ever-so-charismatic yet cocky personality. He is quickly humbled when he finds out he needs to be more careful with his life, and this is where I was instantly hooked.Then enters the big bad wolf, from the wolf's menacing character design, skin trembling voice to the life-threatening fighting style. Wolf was one of the fantastic antagonists. I questioned whether this would be too much for the younger audience because the wolf's scenes struck fear in our beloved Puss. Although, as a viewer, we know nothing serious will happen, I felt this was a strong enough case for the plot.It didn't end there; we are introduced to various fairytale Characters. I am not going to spoil too much.Overall, the movie is fast-paced, has adult humor, and represents a love story, greed, and the beauty of friendship.Verdict: Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a fun time for the family; I would suggest watching it if you have younger ones. Even if you don't have younger ones and are a fan of the Shrek universe, it's worth the watch. Shoutout to Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek for there wonderful performances!",9/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"Poor old Puss has used up eight of his nine lives, now he's a shadow of the cat, that used to thrive, he's residing in a home, no more to dance, to fight, to roam, all the things he so enjoyed, he's now deprived. But Goldilocks, and her three bears, need the cat's claws, to get a map, that's clasped in Jack, Horner's big paws, that will lead them to a star, on a journey wide and far, and a wish that gives them everything and more.And thus follows an enchanting adventure of discovery and realisation, of avarice and excess, of friendship and family and love. Great animation, perfectly delivered dialogue and a universal message relatable to all.",8/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"A delightful animated film that offers fast-paced humor, elaborate visuals, and strong voice acting from a talented cast. Antonio Banderas once again brings charm and depth to the titular character, and Harvey Guillen steals the show as the sweet and enthusiastic Perrito. The dynamic between Puss, Perrito, and Kitty Softpaws (voiced by Salma Hayek Pinault) is engaging and adds substance to what could have been a purely playful endeavor. The film's anime-influenced action sequences are visually striking, and the use of dramatic shadows and subtle dissolves helps to smoothly transition between scenes. Overall, ""Puss in Boots: The Last Wish"" is a fun and visually appealing adventure that is sure to entertain audiences of all ages.",8/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"Wow ! Dreamsworks has always been good with sequels and I think it is safe to say this might be their best sequel to date .Without giving much of the plot there are many new characters and fairy tales introduced here and they actually help elevate the story alongside with being so cute ,loveable and hilarious .Appealing to both kids and adults ,this movie was a treat ,it mixes being a fun continuation to the story without repeating the same tropes of the first movie and also handles heavy topics without feeling grim ,dark or taking itself too seriously.Highly recommended and worth every penny 👌",10/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"LIKES:Pacing
-Very good for kids and adults with short attention spans
-Jumps in and establishes the world quickly so that the adventure can start right off and get us into the goods.-Surprisingly, still establishes story and does a great job of giving the character's the development they need, well mostly
-Is an adventurous pace that really strings along and has excitement, establishing the edge.-Fun overall and jams a lot in a short amount of time.Adorable Characters/Feel
-New characters are adorable, these iconic groups expanded to the next model characters we all want
-Fantastic use of design and voice acting to help further establish gimmicks that kids will be quoting for years to come.-The feel of the movie is indeed adorable, and as the character's continue to evolve that adorable feel comes out even more and wraps so many things up in the nice bow.-Has that element of Shrek that is touching and full of that charm that adds the adorable nature.The Animation
-It's gorgeous at times and still runs smooth, with that attention to anatomy DreamWorks does so well.-The design still mimics the blend of real and fairytale, blending the best of both worlds that we have fallen in love with this series.-The world building is very fun, again familiar trends and architecture, but the spin of things shows the creativity that they can always do that I certainly enjoy with their adult twists to the nursery rhymes.-And it tries new things with the style that sort of work.-Overall , still top notch and better in some aspects than Disney for the blend of real and cartoons.The Voice Acting:
-Many characters are brought to life by the voice more than the animation, as the personalities ooze out of the characters.-Mulaney is hilarious and makes the lines come out with that SNL like delivery that is snarky, well-timed, and enunciated. He own the Horner character and brought some of the best lines.-Wagner Moura is so bone-chilling in his role as the Big-Bad Wolf, and he really is a prime choice for a bad guy to really get that sinister side going.-Though consistency does not make sense, the three bears are charming in their own sense the farther you get in.-Pugh is okay, not my favorite role as Goldi, but certainly there is spark there and what she does throw in is very good for the headstrong leader. Note, the accent is a bit forced, but impressed how she makes it work.-Guillen is the dog, and his enunciation and direction with the cute puppy Is charming and the most adorable thing of the movie. It does start out annoying, but he evolves the energy quite well.-Hayek's reprisal is just fine as always, sassy, calm, but emotional when the time comes and balances things out that really help establish the rival aspect of the cat in shoes.-Banderas takes Boots and reprises the comedy and spirit well with the passion of the Spanish stereotype. And yet, he once again adds elements to him and takes the new emotions that are presented quite well, establishing the growth of the character with the visuals.The References/Jokes
-The stories people remember are back and starting to really become known and connect to the humor of Shrek.-It's dark, twisted, and very well timed at many parts, somehow being relevant, but still fun as it moves with the stories.-The fact the humor is part of the character and not so extremely forced for the most part, again fantastic strategy.-It feels like the first two Shrek's and is a part of it rather than the whole thing. Again, refreshing that they were able to step back.The Designs Changes To An Extent
-Creative and references to several styles that are cool to see.-Like Into the Spiderverse? Good, because it feels partly like that when they issue this style, helping to emphasize the manner of storytelling that Puss does.-Not overused, which is very good for me.The Action At Times
-Shrek is never an action film, but there is a charm and element to it that makes it fun to watch.-This movie does have those moments, having the comedic fun to make things goofy, but also has some circumstances that mix things up and make it fun.-The ending fight shows the potential of what DreamWorks can do when you put the focus and time in, making for one of the better fight scenes I've seen this year.The Heart
-Lots of good character moments that really teach you the lessons of the movie.-The movie is a relevant look at the aspects of life and the things we mortals dream of.-There are lessons in every character, good or bad, that somehow mix very well and sink in because of the natural feel of the story. That's hard to do in many things.-I love the cuteness and how that somehow softens the heart to help things sink in and connect with them and that helps again sell the feel of the movie.-Have not felt this way since Shrek 2.DISLIKES:The Darkness
-It's a necessary element of the story, but at times goes a tad too dark that you may not want young ones exposed to.-Caution with kids, as there is plenty of nightmare fuel for them to see and you need to be cautious.-Might be a tad too sinister at times, and though humorous, again caution with who you might take to see this film, as the lessons might be a bit foreboding and depressing.Predictable
-The lines of the dialog are too laden with foreshadowing to not guess the ending.-The movie's trailers ruined a lot of things and if you remember that can lead to knowing what's coming, which this movie did a little too much and thus ruined the surprise element.-Kind of hard not to guess this from so many other elements to know how this movie is going to end, but if you can turn your memory and clues off, it doesn't' matter.Too Many Antagonists
-One of my biggest complaints is too many antagonists and not enough time to explore them all
-They do tie things up enough that everyone is worth it, but it just doesn't sell them perfectly when you have three sets of baddies and try to make them vie for superiority.-Need one less antagonist that might have made for better cat and mouse games, action, and overall plot development that could have made this an even better movie.-Several character just seem extra and again, did not need all of them in this one movie given the way it ends.The Comedy Is Still Tapered
-It's starting to go back to Shrek, but it's not quite there yet for me.-Still a little tapered to the know and kiddy, alongside the fact that it gets lost in banter and running jokes that things sort of peter out.-Where was the witty retorts and the euphemisms that made Shrek, Shrek.-They took better steps toward the movie though, and there is foundation to build from in the future should more be made.The Animation Changes At Times
-The animation changes are almost always during the fight scenes, and though tapered in amount rob the movie of something.-The comic book feel is cool, but why could we not have more fluid finishes and make it feel like the Spiderman movie style to make the gamble fully worth the experimentation with?-Just felt like add on and would have liked to stay in the lanes or again maximize the use of this style.The Action Still Not Complete
--Shrek and Shrek 2 have the action scenes for this series that are my most enjoyable moments.-This movie has those elements that again brush the quality, but they just don't have the same chemistry and choreography to match that level.-The stakes are starting to return, but fizzle out or are sort of just dragged than elevated.-They sometimes go too silly and return to the level of movies three and four, that are enjoyable, but still not balanced or worth the fight.-Often was shorter than I wanted it to be and the fights just didn't connect as well or utilize all the tools that again the predecessors did. Chaotic and haphazard use is funny, but chaos does lead to sloppy action scenes.The VERDICT
I must say, Puss In Boots: The Last Wish was a much better film than when I walked in. Perhaps it's due to my negative mindset going in, but the movie really does start stepping back to the Shrek roots that pulled me into the series in the first place. Animation is solid and a bit diverse, with acting and direction to help pull the feelings into the character development occurring. It evolves the cat's tale and puts the engaging atmosphere in, with plenty of adorable and heartfelt characters to play in. And it has great voice acting that delivers solid comedy at times and makes for the wild ride that they were making and it does work. This film is indeed a solid return to the world and I had a lot of fun in theater appreciating all the design elements this movie holds. However, the movie is on the right track but has not quite reached the goal and there are still elements that need to continue to rework to get the full magic. Balance is the key really, as the darkness is a little much and the predictability offsetting some of the balance I was looking for. The movie has too many bad guys trying to balance between things that are complete, but not fully realized with Puss In Boots' story and one less might have been a good direction for me personally. And the action and comedy are again hinting at how good things can be, but again is not hitting it out of the park for me and still can return to the quality of the Shrek that we saw in the first two movies. Still, I do recommend giving this movie a shot, but be warned about the darkness to watch out for and be cautious with the kiddos who are sensitive to these things.",8/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"This film is extremely entertaining, hilarious, but also intriguing and can be genuinely intense. It has some very dark scenes and a surprising amount of violence, which is complimented by a ton of great dark humor (mostly brought on by John Mulaney's character). The characters are all very well developed and fleshed out (everyone has backstories for example), many of them get satisfying archs. On the technical side, this film is incredibly animated and every frame looks gorgeous. It has a unique style on the animation that really makes this movie its own, and it doesn't feel like a rip-off of spider verse to me at all. There's a ton of detail and symbolism to analyze with this film as well, especially in the battle scenes between Puss and the Wolf, which have a ton of interesting details and moves (as far as a cat vs a wolf goes).I always complain about finales in animated movies being underwhelming, but this movie had an amazing finale that is not too short or too long, has some amazing battles, character archs, and satisfying moments (also the setpiece they use is AWESOME)This movie is great for kids and adults. It's just that good.",10/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"You heard me! My wife and I just got back from the theater, and absolutely LOVED this movie, even more than any of the Shrek movies and the first Puss in Boots!This movie has SO MUCH to love, from BEAUTIFUL visuals/action to consistent humor that actually had us laughing to engaging characters, both old and new. Such a fun time, and so worth seeing in the theaters, though we'll definitely be picking up a copy once it's out on DVD!Without giving too much away, there are several different antagonists in this movie that scratch all the bad-guy itches, covering the spectrum from totally hateable to horrifying to relatable and sympathetic. A great cast! Also, the magical world they came up with for this movie was awesome, with some really cool/unique features!At first, we were a little worried about the dog character, neither of us being big fans of daffy sidekicks, but we were pleasantly surprised to find ourselves rooting for him! He's hilarious, and that's coming from a cat-lover!Several callbacks to the first Puss in Boots movie made this one feel less like a spin-off than a worthy standalone franchise, and the movie was PACKED with magical references that all ages will be able to recognize and enjoy.Do yourself a favor and free a few hours for this one!! A rare 10 from me!!",10/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"It is beyond crazy how good this movie was. The character development was so very well-done, Puss experiencing fear for the first time, and his fear of mortality was so palpable, well, reasoned and relatable.Death's characterizations was on point, his motivation made complete sense, and he was really horrifying, I totally understood why Puss was so afraid of him.The side characters were all likeable. The dog was a delight, and the bear family's arc was genuinely touching with several emotional moments.They also landed the ending, and the final shot not only gave me major Pirates Of The Carribbean vibes, it also gave me so much hope for what's to come. I would be happy if they made another installment.",10/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is a sequel that wasn't asked for but that just makes it's surprisingly high quality all the better, a sequel that far exceeds the enjoyable original with a mature story about rejecting the fear of death and accepting that life is special because of its mortality.You can tell that Antonio Banderas loves playing this character a lot and it absolutely comes across in his voice acting. He never sounds like he's phoning it in once and still has all the charisma and energy of the character after all these years.Salma Hayek also has just as much energy and charm this time around and has a very natural chemistry with Banderas. Harvey Guillen could've easily become annoying with his endless optimism but that never happens and he's just so lovable and pure.Wagner Moura is note perfect with an all time great animated villain whose threatening voice acting matches his characters visual look so well and is able to bring new life to a film that's already so alive whenever he's on screen.Joel Crawford's direction is amazing, the action sequences are so inventive and fun to watch and the lower frame rate makes them even better. The animation itself is absolutely gorgeous, so much better than what came before with a vibrancy that stuns from beginning to end as an oil painting come to life.",10/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"After losing his eighth life to a bell falling on top of him, Puss in Boots is down to his last life. An encounter from a vicious bounty hunter with a frightening presence destroys his confidence and for the first time, he feels fear. After escaping by the skin of his teeth, he decides he is no longer worthy of the name Puss in Boots and begins life as an adopted cat. He learns about the Dark Forest where someone can make a wish on the Wishing Star. With this in mind, the crafty feline returns to adventure to get his lives back.A little late to review this movie, but I still caught it in theaters. I knew from the trailer that this would be a cool movie. At first, I was wondering why DreamWorks is creating another Puss in Boots movie. It feels weird to make a sequel to a spin-off that came out over a decade ago. As someone who has not watched the original Puss in Boots, I do not think you need to watch the original to get what is going on here aside from maybe Puss' relationship with Kitty Softpaws. With that said, let me tell you how good this movie is!Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is everything I love about animated films. First of all, the animation looks absolutely stunning. The movie has probably the best animation from a CGI film I have ever seen. Not only do the movement and expressions look smooth and crisp, the cinematography and imagery looks amazing and memorable too. There are many awesome shots in this film such as a shot of Puss staring in the eyes of Death. These shots strengthen the emotional moments and even some of the funny moments as well. Every shot in this movie looks awesome. The animation really shows its fluidity in the action scenes. This movie has better action than 90% percent of the live-action blockbusters out there. The set pieces are so dynamic and entertaining that there is not a boring moment in the film. The opening set piece sets the tone for the entire movie and from that point forward, I knew I was in for a ride. The soundtrack is awesome too from the catchy score to the fun opening song for Puss in Boots.Fantastic visuals aside, the story is memorable too. This movie pushes its PG rating. There is blood, cursing and dark themes that may frighten younger viewers. The story is about how Puss is reacting to the idea that he is on deaths door. If he dies one more time, he will be gone forever. This is a movie where we see one of the coolest and most confident characters in animation lose his confidence. With that, he has a character arc that gives him depths and flaws that are relatable so even when he does something kind of selfish, you can still sympathize with his motivations. This movie has a lot of stylish action and funny jokes, but the scenes revolving around the Wolf ramp up the dark tone of the movie. It never loses its sense of humor and this is one funny movie. I love the snarky dialogue, Perrito gets one scene with Goldilocks and the Three Bears that steals the show comedy wise. This movie has the perfect mix of comedy, action, drama and emotional moments to make it stand out.In addition to a great story, the cast of characters are memorable too. Puss is at his best. He is the same awesome and adorable character from Shrek, but he is given a lot of vulnerability here. He starts out as this arrogant, but powerful guy who can take down giants, but when he sees that Death is coming for him, you can see how it shakes him to the core. His friends Kitty Softpaws and especially Perrito are great characters too. Perrito seems like the guy that would annoy everyone, but he is a great support character who is hilarious and just plain adorable. He is also surprisingly aware of emotions. There is one scene with him and Puss that warmed my heart.As for the antagonists, the Wolf is one of my favorite antagonists in an animated film. He has a badass voice, he completely changes the tone of the movie and he wipes out Puss' bravado entirely and reduces him to a frightened cat. He is also a great fighter, but it is his presence, voice, dialogue and whistle that make him truly memorable. Kids might have nightmares because of him. Goldilocks and the Three Bears are fun anti-villains that have a sweet bond with each other. Then there is the gluttonous scumbag Jack Horner. This is the character the writers decided to just make as hilariously hatable and disgusting as possible. They make no attempt to give this guy any sympathetic trait and I love it. We need more outright terrible people in new animated films. He is a funny villain with how unapologetic he is towards his minions, but you will be actively rooting for this character's demise.Every single character in this film is memorable to a degree. It helps that the voice acting in this movie is excellent with Antonio Banderas as Puss, Salma Hayek as Kitty, Harvey Gullén as Perrito, John Mulaney as Jack Horner and especially Wagner Moura as the Wolf. Moura might have one of the best voices for a villain in animation I have seen in a while. Each person brings their character to life in this movie. I can see any main character here being someone's favorite in the movie. That is how you know that you have a great cast.There is not a dull moment in this movie. Puss in Boots: The Last Wish is everything I love about animation and more. I did not expect a movie like this to be that great, but when I saw the trailers with the gorgeous animation, I knew this movie was going to be a ride. I did not expect it to become one of my favorite films of 2022, but it definitely. I really hope it wins best animated feature at the Academy Awards this year. DreamWorks deserves this one. Check it out as soon as you can.",10/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"This movie was a blast!!Saw it in the theatre the day it came out and I LOVED IT!Even if there was a change in animation (Which the one in the 2011 one had more detail), this one still had the spark to a good plotThe audacity between the Wolf and Puss throughout the movie gave it the ""Thriller"" theme somewhat but it was amazing, I am a horror fan and loved that, anytime I see two red glowing dots, I think of the WolfAmazing story, plot, characters, animation, everything, same how I felt with the 2011 version, the 2011 version was the first movie I saw in the movie theatre (I was 4 years old) and it has been my favorite Dreamworks movie ever since, but now this and the 2011 Puss In Boots is tied for my favoritesThis is by far the best movie made in 2022! Amazing job to the Dreamworks team for making such an amazing movie!",10/10
Puss in Boots: The Last Wish (2022),"I can't believe how much I loved this movie, the animation, the script, the characters, the story, even the music, everything about this film is Oscar worthy. Yes, it's really that good. It's hard to believe this is a sequel to a spin-off from a franchise that already had so many movies, this film blows all of them out of the water. Yes, this movie is better than Shrek, just do yourself a favor and watch the film in theaters while it lasts, you will not regret seeing this style of animation on the big screen. My only complaint is John Mulaney was sort of distracting as a voice, I couldn't focus on the character because of the voice.",10/10
M3GAN (2022),"When her parents die, Cady is taken in by her Aunt, to help her come to terms with things, she's given M3GAN, an AI doll, that's very protective.First off, I felt very old in the cinema, aged 40, where most of the viewers seemed to be teenagers, and I think they're perhaps the target audience.Definitely not without appeal, it's an interesting, if unoriginal plot, Child's play vibes, and there are a few jumps here and there. M3GAN does have some intriguing moments, but sadly never flips into horror mode, which I felt the trailers pointed to.The major plus, the visuals, it looks very good indeed, it's nicely shot and well produced, M3GAN's realisation is great, the film peaks towards the end, and the scenes in the forest in particular look very good, and offer the film's most unsettling moments.On the debit side, it's hard to believe in the actions of some of the characters, a few times, I sat there wanting to shout out 'REALLY,' is that actually what they're going to do, but worse, the film was a little too slow in parts.I expected it to be somewhat gruesome, it really wasn't, when I came home from the cinema, I read that it had been cut to fit with a younger audience, I can see that.6/10.",6/10
M3GAN (2022),"Most movies seem to either be underwhelming or just fine. Once in a great while, they over-deliver and exceed your expectations. But possibly the rarest result is when you are excited to see a movie and you get exactly what you'd hoped for. For me, M3GAN was a blast of entertainment, a perfect concoction of a well-paced story that is just there for you to have fun with. Okay, if I'm honest, it did have some moments that elevated my enjoyment even a little more than I'd hoped--they went to a few places I could not have expected. That doesn't mean that the story wasn't predictable; it was pretty clear where this was going the whole time. But it was still fun and memorable, and I expect that if I ever happen to walk into a room where someone has this movie on, I will sit and watch with them to the end. I enjoyed it.",8/10
M3GAN (2022),"M3gan is another example of a movie that was originally meant to be rated R, absolutely should be rated R, but is toned down to PG-13 so they can sell more tickets. Instead of focusing on making something awesome for real movie fans, something people will talk about for years, they focus on the casuals and teens (there were even a few children at my viewing). I continue to ask, when are studios going to stop being cowards and have the courage to go all out?Unfortunately that's far from the only problem with M3gan. My biggest complaint is it feels like such a tease. Part of the reason is the aforementioned limitations which doesn't allow you to be creative with or even show the kills. The other reason is that this movie takes FOREVER to get going. And every time I think, okay here we go, it steps back and makes me wait longer. It's not a long movie, and I don't have a short attention span. I just wanted it to go crazy and it never really did.Other than that, this is just a mediocre movie. I love a good blend of horror and comedy, but the comedy barely made me laugh, and the horror is barely that. With the exception of a solid performance by the main child, I found the rest of the acting to be serviceable at best.If you're like me and feel like this barely scratched an itch, watch Malignant. Oh, it scratches. (1 viewing, opening Thursday 1/5/2023)",4/10
M3GAN (2022),"For the first movie theater experience I had in 2023, M3gan was just not it, this is barely a horror film, and more so a comedy/parody, in the same vein as the 2019 Child's Play remake, take an actually good idea and slap a PG-13 rating on it, you've got M3gan.I don't think I could care about the characters in this movie any less, everyone in this film is either entirely unlikeable or completely incompetent, this is a horror movie, no one wanted to see a doll sing, the stakes weren't there, the shock value was detrimental to the scariness factor, and to top it all off we've got singing dolls and absolutely no blood.M3gan gets a D+",4/10
M3GAN (2022),"The acting is bad, the plot is bad, the entire movie is bad. In this entirely predictable farce, an orphaned kid is sent to live with an aunt who is coding kids toys. Guess what happens next?Act 1 is a slow burn, leading to two minutes of frantic building M3GAN, who becomes orphaned girl's best friend. This movie doesn't know what it's supposed to be. It echoes Big Hero 6 in parts, Chucky in others. IMDb trivia says the film was retooled to appeal to a younger audience, but who? Anyone over 12 won't be interested but it's not suitable for younger kids either. It's not comedy, it's not horror. What it is though, is badly executed.",4/10
M3GAN (2022),"Solid and, at times, actually entertaining. Like other reviewers have mentioned, this strikes me as another version of the 2019 Childs Play; a fun, doesn't-take-itself too-seriously movie. Nonetheless, it added its own spin to the horror/comedy genre with its intentional and unintentional comedy.I went into M3GAN with little to no expectation given the only marketing material I could remember was the dance scene. I found that the film accomplished the message it set out on. Parents suck at raising children and having no parental figure could be deadly because they will get attached to anything that shows them affection.As far as the quality of the film, there wasn't really anything surprising or new I could think of. Most of the elements were very predictable from the beginning. That's not always a bad thing because most people like the predictability and knowing where a film is headed.Overall, not bad for an early January released PG-13 horror movie.",6/10
M3GAN (2022),"Fine, it's a moderately entertaining deadly doll movie but... seriously, it's been a bit overpraised. This is paint by numbers storytelling. A beat by beat remake of every ""deadly friend"" tale. Also, while I generally find her appealing, Allison Williams looks like she's about to crack up half the time. It's also a little soft on the true horror/scares front. Id actually love to see an R rated sequel that goes as hard as ""Child's Play"" or ""Annabelle."" Anyway, it makes me sad to think that there are strong movies out right now (""Babylon,"" ""The Whale"") that audiences are ignoring in favor of this January junk.",5/10
M3GAN (2022),"It seems especially in the horror genre nearly everything lately is regurgitated and advertised as something new. Blumhouse does this more than anyone lately and yet still manages to rake in profits from mostly generation z unfamiliar with the old classic horror films that came long before. The glaring similarities and material borrowing comes from basically every Chucky film, though it's presented in a way that's more appetizing to the newer tik tok gen z crowd. Not saying the film isn't still executed solidly or isn't effective. It just feels like such an obvious rewrapping of an old classic.The film itself has a solid enough story and decently intriguing visuals to keep it interesting. The acting is subpar at times but the shock value makes up for it. The true issues lay in the blatant lack of originality toward the overall product. Slight futuristic advancements in plot points and cgi can only differentiate from the old so much when something feels so familiar.",6/10
M3GAN (2022),"After watching the first trailer, I was excited to watch the movie and after hearing positive reviews my expectations rose. After watching the movie, it felt like I didn't see anything new. It was just same robot becoming enemy due to malfunction. The horror or thrilling elements were missing from the story. One thing I liked about the story was they tried to be realistic but we have seen this type of story millions of times. I don't know what will they do with the sequel. Maybe, make it a franchise like Child's Play. Who knows?Overall, it was a normal movie which I think you can give a try.",5/10
M3GAN (2022),"I didn't vibe with M3gan's trailer when I first saw it. Killer artificial intelligence has been done time and time again plus adding the killer doll tropes just made it seem all the more cliche. But then the reviews came out, with critics heralding M3gan as a ""campy masterpiece"" and ""hilarious"" which admittedly piqued my interest. Having now seen M3gan, it's a comedy first but there's enough horror here to still qualify it for the genre. There are moments where M3gan is running down a prospective victim or doling out her varied forms of punishment that had me shuddering in my seat. Most of it is happening off screen but I was pleasantly surprised by how far the movie pushed the envelope, even if it was only implied. So while I can't call M3gan horrific or even scary, there's sufficient creepy material to qualify it for the genre still.Even though M3gan is kind of sporting the horror genre as a mask, I was mostly impressed with what the movie decided to focus its efforts on. Starting with the characters, I was surprised at how rough and awkward they made Gemma's character. This was actually a plus for me, it setup her reasons for pushing M3gan further even when it wasn't prudent to do so. She doesn't have paternal instincts and continues to be largely selfish so why not create something to do it for her? (this is obviously problematic thinking but more on that later). It also made her eventual connection with Cady more improbable yet believable. The film also points out the unhealthy nature of Cady's attachment to M3gan several times in a clinical fashion. It establishes the stakes of how Gemma's choices have put Cady's mental health in jeopardy and possibly caused long-term damage to her. I also appreciated Gemma's team (Cole and Tess) calling her out for her continued disregard of Cady in favour of her work. Surprisingly, M3gan also had a few moments when she's trying to convince people to see things ""her"" way that she was surprisingly persuasive. Those moments helped me see her as more than just a mindless murdering machine. The only character that they missed the mark with is Gemma's boss David who is just too cartoonish to buy as an actual person. This decision seems to have been made to help make the corporate climate in the movie feel more ridiculous but they could have turned it down a notch without harming the overall tone. I wouldn't call it exemplary or superior character building but there's enough work put in to build tension and get you to care about the characters even if it's in a passive way.M3gan only centres around a few characters so there isn't a huge cast to talk about. Allison Williams capably anchors the movie as Gemma. I haven't seen her in much since Get Out but her work in that was no fluke. She sells the unlikeable Gemma and then when she learns the error of her ways, she does a decent job of managing the turn. Violet McGraw does a good job as the largely meek and gentle Cady. Her scenes where she flips out are startling and not as believable but she still grades out well overall. Ronny Chieng is a little over-the-top as David but I have to assume he was being directed that way, even if not I still appreciate that he went for it as opposed to just slouching through it. Lori Dungey was also good, her character starts out as unassuming but becomes nastier as the proceedings keep moving. She kept it light enough to keep you from getting distracted but dark enough that you only felt so bad for her.I've talked about almost all of the other larger components of M3gan, the biggest and most notable takeaway is that if you've got a darker sense of humour, M3gan is pretty funny throughout. From minute one, M3gan let's you know what's up. The original Funki toys are so off-putting that they can't be taken sincerely and their functions are so comedic that the movie is making poop jokes with them. As much as I want to credit the design work and acting required to bring M3gan to life, she's so far in the uncanny valley that she must be a permanent resident. The thought that anyone would buy her for their child is laughable. If you saw her in real life, you would shriek and run the other way instead of trusting her to care for your kids. To the movie's credit, this is clearly done intentionally and the creative team is winking at the audience. The scene where M3gan starts dancing to distract her prey is so creepily comedic that I was openly laughing at the thought that anyone would take it seriously. M3gan isn't as uproarious as the Happy Death Day series but they hit the right balance to make a good campy comedy.My advice with M3gan is to not take it too earnestly and go in ready to acknowledge how ridiculous it is. You're clearly supposed to be laughing with it and I did continuously. The critical praise has been a little hyperbolic but it's more difficult to achieve the correct mixture for something like this to work. I would happily recommend M3gan to horror enthusiasts looking for something that plays with the formula for comedic effect. I would grade it as a 7.5/10 rounding up in this case to an 8/10. A sequel has already been announced and I'm looking forward to checking it out when it's released.",8/10
M3GAN (2022),"So, was highly skeptical of this one after reading reviews & of course, seeing the previews. But after viewing, the film wasn't too bad. But it wasn't much cop either & the reviews were right in a good couple of aspects.The film basically sees a child named Cady who after losing both her parents gets adopted by her Aunt Gemma who is a toy maker who creates M3gan, a robotic prototype toy that her adoptive quickly gets attached to. However, is the toy robot Megan, more than just a toy robot!?I found the film alright. It wasn't amazing & did take a while to get going. There was too much story & talky talk scenes I think & the characters felt thin & more robotic than Megan ""herself"" ironically enough. Speaking of which the portrayal of the male characters was a let down, while it wasn't in your face, it was there enough to make you tut & shake your head in disappointment. E.g. The male scientist & the father at the start of the film both being portrayed as a bumbling fools, the line being ushered to the bully ""BaD bOyS bEcOmE bAd MeN."", but aside from slight male insulting jibes, it wasn't too bad.The horror was very minimal for 15 rated horror. I've seen more gore in a Bond Film & that's saying something. The deaths were pretty bad as well as the body count, they cut away & ruin what so called horror was salvageable in this film. The runtime isn't bad at 94 minutes, 1 hour & 34 minutes, but the pacing wasn't the greatest. The ending wasn't bad & entertaining & there were some laughs to be had in this flick also.Overall, it's heavily overrated. It lacks horror badly as well as gore & a body count to speak of. The little male insulting jibes were unneeded as they are in any film & the story & pacing could've used some work too. With a few laughs, a robotic cast & premise that's been done before, this was pretty below average.3/10.",3/10
M3GAN (2022),"First hype of 2023 is this horror flick coming from the hands of writer Wan. You know, the guy from Saw and The Conjuring amongst others. So I expected a lot from this flick.Sorry to say but for me it wasn't what I expected. It was low on horror and it became more of a thriller. And the reason is simple, it used to be a R-rated flick but while editing this flick they agreed to make it a PG-13 flick, so low on horror and the red stuff.It's not a bad flick, it's what we can expect from the future but even as it is entertaining and the story is okay for me personally it failed to be called a horror.Gore 0/5

M3GAN (2022),"What do you get when you mix Chucky and Terminator? Well you get M3GAN a highly intelligent ai that will protect its user no matter what.Well first thing I wish to say is Happy New Year to those who are reading this. It's always fun and exciting to enter a new year of theater-going. A clean slate of the garbage films we have seen in the previous year and a chance to hopefully see and experience new worlds and exciting stories. Damn it if the Cinema isn't one of the most magical places on the face of this Earth. Because when the lights dim and the projector shines everything else just fades away.Anyway, on with the review....M3GAN I am happy to say was an enjoyable, entertaining way to open this new year with. Not a completely unique concept but very intriguing all the same.Following the death of her parents Cady (Violet McGraw) is placed in custody of her aunt Gemma (Allison Williams) in an attempt to help her niece cope with the death of her parents she invents M3GAN or Model 3 Generative Android, I'll just stick to M3GAN its easier.Allison Williams and Violet McGraw give good performances and the material they are given is very solid. Though the standout here is obviously M3GAN played by two different actresses Amie Donald and Jenna Davis they both performed fantastically as this artificially intelligent android. They were both very convincing in how they moved and talked both looking and sounding very robotic.While the first two acts were really good, filled with good storytelling, writing, and acting what holds this film back for me is a rather, how can I put it, a third act that just didn't quite hit the mark. M3GAN's first two victims or maybe three, had a purpose she killed them because she viewed them as legitimate threat to the emotional and physical well being of her user Cady. But in the third act she started killing to well kill and that's just not intriguing to me, particularly the third act felt out of tune from the rest of the film.Overall this was a solid film and one I did not expect to enjoy.IMDb: 7/10

M3GAN (2022),"Hands down the better reboot of Child's Play than Child's Play (2019). Although it's predictable from start to finish, it was at least a better made movie in terms of production design and cinematography.And yes when you think about it too much, a lot of it doesn't make any sense. Why are all of the adults dumb or willfully ignorant when it comes to implementing AI into their prototype? Why didn't they have the slightest foresight or precautions in store if something goes wrong? Why does a puppet for kids posses the strength of a Terminator? And if said robot is so dangerous, why not disconnect the brain chip entirely from the body when doing any fail safe tests?But even with all the predictability and the leaps in logic I was still entertained. Maybe because I haven't seen a trailer, the movie had actually some neat visual ideas in store. I liked some of the cinematography, there were some pretty interesting shots in the forest and towards the end. The choreography of the puppet was pretty well done, it is a blend of animatronics, mo-cap and vfx animation, depending on the shot. The movie is a bit tame in terms of showing actual violence. The actual showdown could have been a bit more creative. It felt like the 7th studio re-write to punch up the final confrontation but it felt somehow weak, I expected a bit more shock value. Basically it's like a glorified Black Mirror episode, but without going too dark unfortunately. It's still a solid horror movie for the average moviegoer or as an introduction into horror movies. But I'm afraid horror fans might be a bit disappointed by the lack of commitment the movie has towards the genre.",6/10
M3GAN (2022),"Why would you make a robot doll that is super strong and that has no safety protocols? Because this is a stupid movie written by stupid people. Why even make a doll for kids super strong? Every robot should have a kill switch. Don't these idiot watch any robot movies before? They are very advance and can create an ai robot but they don't have security cameras around the house? They never fully tested the doll but they were going to release it? And how much would the doll cost? They never mentioned it because it would be a ridiculous price. Also, you can make such an advance robot. Why isn't the government looking into this? Make a doll instead of a super solider? Good acting and production ruined by stupid things.",1/10
M3GAN (2022),"There really isn't much to complain about this little gem. It had everything going for it, from casting to production to directing etc. The story had a great flow to it, and although it was mostly predictable, it was still really fun to go along for the ride. All casting and performances were spot-on, although I felt Ronny Chieng was miscast. I am a fan, but somehow his character just didn't fit and wasn't as convincing as everyone else was. The visual effects for Megan were on point, as was the cinematography and score. The 102 min runtime flew by with the proper pacing. Overall a really fun watch and I certainly recommend it. I do hope they come out with at least one more sequel.",8/10
M3GAN (2022),"ME3AN does a great job with the ""look"" and aethetics of the doll in terms of it being the central element of the film. The premise of the film is also relatively logical, but much more far-fetched... orphaned girl lives with AI and robotics ""expert"" at a toy company. Who happens to be her aunt.What would have really made this movie great is if the threat from M3GAN was more subtle and insidious. Instead this movie was made by dumb people for dumb people.In modern robotics, AI software development and advanced mechanical engineering are separate disciplines. They are the two distinct engineering specializations that require a person to be the best in the world, even far exceeding what the US Military and its infinite budget cannot achieve (at least that we know of). There is no human on Earth who is equally skilled at AI code development and android mechanical engineering.Beyond that, why does a child's toy have military-grade Terminator strength? I know it's a prototype model, butAnd why would a toy company have this tech?I love how they gloss over the impossibility of this android having an internal power supply to run all that tech. The IBM AI that won Jeopardy required a room full of computing horsepower. Some of that has been miniaturized, but still... the processing power is enormous to replicate even a handful of human brainpower.And that's not counting the even greater power requirements for all those joints, servos and motors so the android can move and propel itself. Especially to the Terminator level of strength and speed shown in the movie. It's just DUMB.Write it better. Write for smart people. Make the premise believable. Set the movie in the distant future at least.The final fight is awful and idiotic. No character uses strategy to defeat M3GAN. Nor does the android do anything clever. It just attacks relentlessly. Somehow it can control a McLaren sports car wirelessly... shades of the very awful Terminator 3 android.The acting is pretty bad. David, the 35 year old CEO of a tech company doesn't act like a CEO. He is what a 23 year old screenwriter thinks a CEO acts like. He's comically dumb and obnoxious in a way that exaggerates and takes you out of the movie's world.If you're capable of shutting your brain off, have at it. I just found myself thinking ""why is this movie written and directed so poorly?""",5/10
M3GAN (2022),"A film full of unlikable characters whom we care nothing about, a plot so thin it's like toilet paper. We know exactly what is going to happen from the get-go since it's the same as the trailer. It's never explained why the doll is evil, how she is created so quickly in like a week or how her AI works, . There are no real subplots, no real character development, just scene after scene of a creepy doll, an annoying girl and her clueless aunt. It's said there was a R version and it was cut down to gain a teen audience but I can't imagine more violence would make this any better.

M3GAN (2022),"The insane opening sequence firmly sets the tone. A family of three (husband, wife, young girl) appears to be driving head-first into a major snowstorm. As the audience tries to absorb this, the wife berates the husband for lying to a policeman about the car being 4WD -- when it really isn't! Still following?? Then, my favorite part, as the blizzard completely envelopes the car with a whiteout, the wife demands the husband stop right where he is -- in the middle of the road! -- so they can resolve their argument. If you are married, maybe that will make some sort of sense to you, but it is a heck of a way to start a movie. Seconds later, an oncoming truck hits them and --BAM-- the young girl is now an orphan. Bottom line, this is slickly produced, above-average, little horror flick that delivers on its core promise, which is to simply entertain. Nowhere in the PR package does it mention the word ""Chucky."" Enjoy it for what it is. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

M3GAN (2022),"""M3GAN"" is a crowd pleaser - after seeing this in a packed auditorium (complete with young kids sneaking in and sitting in the empty seats that I bought exclusively so people would not sit next to me), the roll of the credits marked the sound of uproarious applause by the entire theatre. And to be quite honest, that was the last thing I expected when walking into a film about a killer doll; but who am I to judge the taste of today's viewing audience? That said, even after experiencing the sheer joy of an over 100 person standing ovation - for me - ""M3GAN"" fell short.There is something novel about watching M3GAN (the character) interact with the world around her; from her surprisingly empathetic approach toward helping a young child overcome the loss of her parents to the way that she adapts to her environment to always say the right thing, do the right thing, and act in the most appropriate manner, is endlessly entertaining. Voiced by Jenna Davis, M3GAN is also a joy to listen to, and not just when she's talking. From ""Titanium"" to Sia, M3GAN randomly - and hilariously - covers the decades most beloved pop songs; even when she's not singing, though, Jenna adds an extremely expressive voice to her character, one that cuts through the creepy, uncanny-valley-esque face that M3GAN has, allowing the audience to truly begin to like and connect with the doll... at least before it begins to murder people.Alas, though M3GAN at first seems like every child's dream toy, it slowly but surely begins its descent into calamity once it gets a taste for violence; so bloodthirsty is the doll, in fact, that not even dogs are safe from its wrath. Utilizing an impressive range of weapons from paper cutter guillotines to pressure washer devices, the toy expresses its desire for revenge in a multitude of ways - after all, variety is the spice of life. And since you're most likely coming into this movie to watch this adorable AI invention kill people, you'll certainly find some entertainment value in that regard. More brutal than I expected for a PG-13 film, the movie does have some mildly grotesque imagery here and there that certainly enhances the effect of the violence. However, the movie does remain light and humorous in tone throughout its running time, which I did like.A dark comedy through and through, ""M3GAN"" is sure to instill dread in its audience while simultaneously making them cackle in laughter. There's something ominous about watching M3GAN slowly make her way down a claustrophobic, dimly lit hallway, but there's also something ridiculous about watching her dance in that same hallway before beginning her rampage. Similarly, it's disturbing to watch M3GAN stalk and hunt her victims, but it's comedic to watch her sing pop songs after the killing is through. Perfectly balancing both horror and comedy, ""M3GAN"" is sure to find multiple ways to entertain its audience.Positives aside, I do feel as if this movie is lacking; more specifically, I feel as if it should've had one or two more surprises up its sleeve, as I found this movie to be completely predictable from beginning to end - the trailer does no favors in this regard, as it shows way too much, leaving very little to viewer imagination. Additionally, I thought that the movie teased multiple exciting set pieces or sequences that never really went anywhere. I won't spoil anything, but let's just say that the movie forgoes its seemingly promised bombastic conclusion for something more decidedly small in scale.That said, I do think that ""M3GAN"" is a fun film. It's nothing groundbreaking, but I do think that most viewers will find a lot to enjoy here. My recommendation: Go into this slightly intoxicated and without thinking too hard about what you're about to see; watching ""M3GAN"" this way is sure to enhance your viewing experience and allow you to bask in this throwback, campy horror film.",7/10
M3GAN (2022),"So a toy company that makes basic talking pets can make the most sophisticated artificially intelligent doll in history. Doesn't make sense. A woman that created the doll uses it to babysit her niece rather than hiring a living, breathing babysitter. Also doesn't make sense. The A. I. doll kills people left and right and the woman who created it is absolutely oblivious to it even though it's extremely obvious. Really doesn't make sense. This movie is filled to the brim with nonsensical things. The woman who created the doll and allows it babysit her niece should have Child Protective Services called on her. She cares more about the doll and money than her own flesh and blood. This movie is about artificial intelligence but it's pathetically unintillegent.",3/10

It's not long before machine and niece connect, takes the role of parenting without neglect, keeps a watch on its young guard, any threat, it will discard, with a mission to defend, secure, protect. Before too long you have concerns as the creator, your brainchild has become a calculator, a consciousness that learns, considers all the twists and turns, perhaps it's time to pull the plug, and terminate her.A variation on several themes you've encountered many times before but entertaining nonetheless and thought provoking as well.",7/10
M3GAN (2022),"This movie could have been great if only it had a better writing team. The plot as it is is very derivative, lazy at times and formulaic. Something straight out the cookie cutter sci-fi mould.Smart person invents sentient AI robot (M3gan) which goes on to befriend a vulnerable person (traumatised child). The AI turns bad (of course it does - lazy writing) and starts killing people. The creator tries to destroy the robot but fails (predictable) and the befriended character ends up being the one to kill it (again predictable) but not before defending and disputing the accusations against the robot. Hints of The Lawn Mower man at the end suggesting the AI lives in the closing shots (leaving an opening an opening for a sequel).The VFX aren't too bad and I'm glad they didn't go down the Ex Machina route of making the robot have a realistic human face although that does present a plot hole. If you've got the technology to give the robot the levels of dexterity and motor control as M3GAN presents then you'd easily have the technological ability to make the face and facial expressions realistic to pass as human.Sounds design isn't great though as it was difficult to understand what M3GAN was saying at times but maybe that is just my hearing.All in all, not a terrible movie but don't expect any surprises.",5/10
M3GAN (2022),"I never expect much from modern horror movies aside from some mildly entertaining scares and a fun story. The infamous 'corridor dance' scene shown on the trailer for M3GAN was what got me to gather some friends in the cinema for a laugh and maybe a cheap scare or two. Whilst there weren't any considerable scares in the movie at all, there was no shortage of laughter. Almost all attempts of comedy fell flat on its face, which was made up for in laughable scares and extremely goofy chase scenes. The protagonist 'Gemma' is completely lifeless and unlikeable which stands as a result of poor acting and writing. Any of the audiences attempts to relate or care for her at all are severed by her complete disregard for any of the situations she finds herself in and lack of emotion or empathy portrayed by her character. She doesn't seem to be really bothered at all about the insane s happening, which actually led me to anticipate a twist in which it is revealed that she is in fact a robot as well. The fact that M3GAN herself displays more human characteristics than the main character astounds me. With that said, no-one had a good performance but 'Gemma' was a product of careless writing and acting.Also -8 points for the water spill drawing scene like what.",1/10
M3GAN (2022),"A brilliant toy company roboticist uses artificial intelligence to develop M3GAN, a life-like doll programmed to emotionally bond with her newly orphaned niece. But when the doll's programming works too well, she becomes overprotective of her new friend with terrifying results.This felt super cool and fresh. It carried the comedy without feeling too funny. It had the horror and the spookiness without making it too gory and disturbing for some watchers. This will probably be one of my fav thrillers of the year! Blumhouse did a amazing job making this movie scary but not scary enough for a R rating. It landed a PG-13 Rating. Overall super exciting and I totally would recommend this film!",8/10
Bullet Train (2022),"Rare seeing Brad Pitt in a movie like this but from what I understand the director is a good friend of his. It's an action movie the reads like Smoking Aces. An ensemble cast with a few different stories in it, of which, interestingly enough Brad Pitt's story as a man named Ladybug could be considered just as important as the others despite being the star.Unlike Smoking Aces, the Bullet Train in itself is a character and a very expensive one that makes it a blockbuster. On top of that the very cool Celebrity Cameos that prove this director makes friends with everyone he works with in Hollywood.The Japanese back drop was cool not just because I'm an anime fan but because it made the film and the bullet train visual amazing to look at, but Hollywood needs more Japanese actors who can speak English. Hiroyuki Sanada is become the Danny Trejo of the Far East.Its action packed and its humorous everything I want when watching a movie in theatres.",9/10
Bullet Train (2022),"This is a highly entertaining action-comedy that oozes style. It's extremely fun and a bit on the outrageous side, not meant to be taken too seriously. It's filled with funny and memorable moments. The action is awesome, well-shot and clear, which is no surprise coming from the guy who directed John Wick, Atomic Blonde and Deadpool 2.There are a ton of characters and I like them all. The cast does such a great job, especially Brian Tyree Henry and Aaron Taylor-Johnson. I remember first seeing Brian Tyree Henry in Atlanta and really enjoying that role. Since then, he has taken on vastly different roles and killed all of them. And I already thought Aaron Taylor-Johnson is a great actor, but the way he completely transforms into his character is remarkable. To the point where you don't see Aaron Taylor-Johnson. Literally. I didn't realize it was him until the credits rolled.If I had to come up with negatives, I would say it's a bit hectic at times, but not enough to take me out of it. And the story borders on being convoluted, but I was able to follow it all so I'll call it intricate instead.In the end I had a great time with this movie and would definitely watch it again, although I'll be turning on subtitles since some dialogue was hard to understand in a Snatch kind of way.EDIT: On second viewing, my negatives disappeared. And a couple things that stood out even more: The music is beastly and Brad Pitt's facial expressions in the reaction shots are priceless. (2 viewings, early screening UltraScreen 8/2/2022, UltraScreen 8/17/2022)",8/10
Bullet Train (2022),"If you're fed up of dreary Oscar contenders making points and taking an age to get to them, this is for you. Entertaining, fast paced, action romp with good set pieces and plenty of fun moments.And to the critics: no, there is no ""character development"" and yes, the ""plot"" is not that believable. It's light entertainment not Samuel Beckett.",7/10
Bullet Train (2022),"Was excited heading into this because it's the first movie I watched on early release. Tried to avoid spoilers so assumed it was going to be Japanese/Korean just because I kept thinking of Train to Busan when I heard the title.Anyway, it was pretty decent, the actors performances are great all around, it wasn't just Brad Pitt doing most of the heavy lifting. A lot of star cameo's; standout for me was Channing Tatum, felt tit-for-tat after Brad's cameo in The lost City. I was also glad to hear Kimiko from the boys finally speak lol. The comic scenes and action were great, I liked how they were mostly in short bursts and quick. Directed by the same person who did Deadpool, John wick, Hobbs & Shaw... liked that it had the same level of action but as frivolous as Hobbs & Shaw. I was a bit dubious about Joey King taking a lead role because I often think of her as someone in cheesy Netflix teen romcoms but she did alright.I was curious as to see what interesting plot it'd have if everything takes place on one train ride, but Snowpiercer and Busanhaeng did it, why not this. They tried to make a big deal out of ""fate"" but really the movie is just a rather star-studded cast, most don't get long to show what they got but had fun with the little time they have. So if you're to enjoy it, watch it to have fun, not to get meaning from it.I did feel like some scenes were a tad bit too long especially in the first half, and it wasn't exactly predictable but it did lack some suspense. You know everyone on the train's somehow connected so the stories will merge in the end but you didn't know how it'd get there, yet still no suspense. I don't think it's a mind-blowing film but it did what it was trying to do. Also felt like a fun spaghetti western on a Japanese train. They tried to give the characters some depth but it wasn't much, the plot's sometimes weak and that's irrelevant because it's not what the movie is for. Not something to make sense of, it's just one of those nonsensical fun action films that appeal to the part of your brain that likes seeing things blow up or car chases to get your heart pumped. Also stay around for the post credits right after.",8/10
Bullet Train (2022),"Even though it goes off the rails with an overblown CG finale Bullet Train is still a total blast from beginning to end thanks to the endless visual style, surprising twists and plenty of gleefully violent and energetically shot/choreographed action set pieces.Brad Pitt gives a terrific lead performance, completely unafraid to make fun of himself whilst still being a capable action star. The standouts of the film with their perfect chemistry and great humour is Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry.Hiroyuki Sanada and Andrew Koji are definitely the heart of the film with soulful performances and the most emotional sub-plot that skillfully balance out all the humour and irreverence.David Leitch's direction is amazing, the film just oozes style with gorgeous lighting, vibrant colours and inventive camera work. The soundtrack is excellent, all the song choices work and never feel like they're trying too hard.",8/10
Bullet Train (2022),"I make a point of not watching trailers prior to watching a new film as experience tells me that rather than get me excited to watch a movie, they essentially give me an overly exposed look at a film with key plot points being shown. With this in mind, it was almost impossible to not see parts of trailers for Bullet Train, whether that was on TV or YouTube advertising etc. The marketing campaign for this film is mental, I have seen it everywhere.The trailer makes the movie look like a massive bloated action piece - Think Nonstop meets Train to Busan. However, having watched a couple of YouTube film reviews, I was pleasantly surprised to see it described as not just a brainless action movie, but more of a dialogue-based film with clever writing and fast paced back and forth. One reviewer compared it to Guy Ritchie's Snatch and the classic Pulp Fiction - Two of my favourite and most watched movies. That was enough for me, I was going to give it a try and I booked a couple of tickets for opening day, something that I don't do very often.Let's start with the Dialogue. If anything, it just tries too hard, far too hard. Most of the jokes didn't land for me and the delivery of the fast-paced dialogue quite often would not hit the mark. I can't quite but my finger on why that is. Is it simply poor writing? Or is it down to the delivery? Or is it simply that a number of my favourite movies are heavy, witty dialogue-based movies and my expectations were so high based on several reviews, that I just felt disappointed by this? Either way, it didn't really work for me.As you can imagine, almost all the action scenes involved in this movie were delivered on a train, meaning that the fight scenes needed to be compact and tight. This was delivered better than I expected to be fair and plenty of the action scenes were enjoyable, if not incredibly farfetched.The characters were relatively varied but were quite generic and cliché. Brad Pitt is essentially the lead actor and probably the best on show. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Brian Tyree Henry (Tangerine and Lemon) were the characters which I was most excited to see, they played the east end cockney gangster/hitmen type characters. Unfortunately, they came across as just trying far too hard and the chemistry between them just wasn't as good as I imagine the director and producers thought it would be. The Thomas the Tank Engine metaphor also got repetitive after the 25th time it was mentioned. The rest of the cast are hit and miss, nothing majorly impressive and nothing majorly terrible. There are some strange cameos, and when I say cameos, I mean cameos. They literally get seconds of screen time.Overall, Bullet Train was entertaining enough as a popcorn flick and was an inoffensive way of turning my brain off for two hours and relaxing. I do feel that it's a slightly wasted opportunity though as I can see what the director was trying to do, but it just felt flat and missed the mark on quite a few occasions. Style over substance is the best way I would describe it.6/10.",6/10
Bullet Train (2022),"I can't remember the last time I saw a film as full on as 'Bullet Train'. It is two hours of relentless action. It's actually a little exhausting to watch (it didn't help that the theatre I saw it in was set to about 30 degrees Celsius - but that's a different matter) - in a good way though.This is a very stylishly made film. It looks terrific. The acting is great and all the characters are very polished and cool as you would expect in a film about assassins. The train itself is an interesting setting too. It's technically a single-setting film but it never feels like it. The film moves so fast you feel like you are darting from country to country.I would say the one let down of the film was how little of the humour landed. Time and again there was an obvious attempt at a joke and I just didn't find even a smile coming to my face. There are some laughs along the way, but the hit to miss ratio is way off.It's a lot of fun this movie though regardless. There are endless cameos and twists and unexpected moments. The film certainly keeps you on your toes. 7/10.",7/10
Bullet Train (2022),"This movie grabs you from the start and doesn't let go. Its an entertaining whirlwind of goofy character after goofy character, and awesome fight after awesome fight.

While soundtrack is fine but not too memorable outside of the film.Overall, this is a great summer watch.",8/10
Bullet Train (2022),"This was like Guy Ritchie, Matthew Vaughn & Quentin Tarantino had a three-way in the late 1990s/early 2000s and Bullet Train was the result.I really, REALLY think this movie thought it was way smarter and much more hilarious than it ever was, in any rewrite. Undeniably, I did chuckle for approximately 12 seconds of the 2 hour, 7 minute runtime. I do recognize there was humor throughout, it just didn't land for me.Multiple strangers on a train/villain stereotype of decades past keep overlapping their stories, goals and one-liner/bullets are flying everywhere. Trying to keep up on a bullet train isn't as easy as they make it look.This action/comedy is Fast & Furious impossible. There were a few incidences in the first half that made me do a double take in this seemingly ""realistic"" film. But, the stunts and way people survive the incredible got progressively cornier.It's watchable as I was able to make it all the way to the end. I've been looking forward to this since it was released 4 months ago and I'm super glad I could watch for free on Netflix (friend pays for the service.) I would've really been let down if I had seen this in theatres. It was just meh.When the lead (Brad Pitt) doesn't even look that interested in being on the train, it's hard to have enthusiasm to get to the end.***Final Thoughts: But, admittedly, the last act was better than the first two...as long as you leave your brain right at that door. It's gonna get silly crazy.",4/10
Bullet Train (2022),"I'll admit i've skewed my rating a bit, i've ranked it so highly rated based on the fact I knew what movie I was buying a ticket for. I'm not rating it highly because it's a modern classic, i'm doing it based on wanting to see a funny and entertaining action movie and in that respect it delivers pretty much everything I went to the cinema for.The premise of the film is basic, the cast is solid, the characters are excellent including mini side characters. The humour has a few misses but generally it is a pretty funny movie throughout, they also pay off everything that is set up along the way which makes it a satisfying watch. Also if you are yet to see it, stay through the credits as it does tie up one or two of those loose ends.The slight downside for me, were that the run time does sag a little toward the end but it is over 2 hours long and otherwise moved along at a steady rate.",9/10
Bullet Train (2022),"SCORE: 10/10That was one of the craziest things I have ever seen and it all makes sense now. I always tell people that Deadpool 2 is the movie I point at to describe what I love in a movie. The same guy who directed Deadpool 2 directed this, David Leitch, and he is an absolute genius. This movie was a never ending plot twist masterpiece combined with top tier comedy, fun, action, and even some unexpected cameos. After seeing the trailer, I knew this was going to be a fun movie, but I didn't imagine I would enjoy it as much as I did.The success of this movie can be directly attributed to both a great story and amazing acting all around. The entire cast did such a great job that I really can't single out one person for carrying this movie. Just like in Deadpool 2, there were multiple points at which the story could've ended and I would've been satisfied, but it just kept getting better and better and better. I still feel some type of way about Tangerine dying after Lemon and The Elder's son came back to life. Other than that, this movie was perfect.The way that this story was told was so creative and impressive, especially since they were able to tell it for pretty much the entire movie being in one location. The title cards when introducing characters was awesome and it found a way to be funny without being silly. A silly movie sometimes takes away from the rest of the story, but a majority of the humor was well timed, well executed, and consistent. The plot twists were insane and I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen while waiting to see what would happen next. And yes, Ryan Reynolds and Channing Tatum sure did contribute to this perfect score.",10/10
Bullet Train (2022),"Bullet Train is a nonstop thrill ride that delivers some of the most fun I've had watching a film in ages. Don't listen to the critics.

Taylor-Johnson and Henry are the other obvious standouts. Dripping in style, this film is exactly what I was hoping it would be.I was pleasantly surprised by how much depth and creativity the story ended up having. There are lots of fun callbacks for viewers who pay close attention as well.

The writing was terrible, and the humor just didn't work.It took itself too seriously in some parts and not seriously enough in others, and it was just a pathetic mishmash of a mess.

Bullet Train (2022),"Another Quentin Tarantino wannabe that failed spectacularly. The ingredients are all to recognizable: a bunch of weird characters, lots of violence, funny soundtrack and lots of flashbacks. But despite all these Tarantino ingredients ""Bullet Train"" simply hasnt got any movie magic or soul.The bad: it's not funny. They have TRIED to make it funny, with lots of silly English accents and supposedly silly situations, but I didnt laugh once. Not once.More bad: it's static. Nothing much happens. Everything takes part in the same setting of the train. That shouldnt have been a problem PROVIDED the characters and the story were strong and interesting. But unfortunately both were NOT interesting at all.Not any good then? Perhaps best suited for those who are just into a brainless ""action"" movie with lots of blood shed. Perhaps fans of that will be interested in watching it.I got bored. Really bored. Why? Because I NEED BELIEVABLE characters and an interesting suspenseful story with true to life dialogues. NONE of that was present. Big DISAPPOINTMENT. I had been warned by many others that ""Bullet Train"" was a failure and they were absolutely right!",4/10
Bullet Train (2022),"STAR RATING: ***** Brilliant **** Very Good *** Okay ** Poor * AwfulLadybug (Brad Pitt) is a renowned assassin, going through a stage of enlightenment and reflection in his life, who wants out of the life. However, he finds himself on another assignment in Tokyo, on a bullet train (hence the title), where he must retrieve a suitcase from a target, being guarded by cockney duo Tangerine (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Lemon (Brian Tyree Henry.) Meanwhile, with his son's life in jeopardy, another assassin, Kimura (Andrew Koji) boards the train, and falls under the charge of angel faced killer Prince (Joey King.) It all builds to a climactic showdown with the notorious gangster White Death (Michael Shannon), who holds the key to it all.Arriving with a flurry of late stage publicity, but weirdly no press screenings in the UK, word of mouth lead to a shoot of success for David Leitch's star studded action adventure romp, swiftly sending it up the box office charts. But a mix of good and bad reactions ensued, and with a dearth of other new releases opening up, little else was left for the average filmgoer to go and see. And so, I was left to go and observe the impending train wreck for myself. And the results, on an individual level, sadly really failed badly.Director David Leitch seems to have watched every Quentin Tarantino/Guy Ritchie film back to back (especially the Kill Bill films) and appears to have dreamed up his own awkward, desperate wannabe tribute to those films, but has just conjured up an annoyingly see through and unsuccessful mess, with dialogue (most notably a continuous, truly grating thread involving Thomas the Tank Engine!) and lingering slo-mo shots that would make his two most obvious inspirations blush. It would have helped if the script was a little better written, but it's just a disjointed, incoherent effort, employing the over-exposed 'reverse plotting' trend so popular today, and by the end truly beginning to drag on.It thinks it's funny. It isn't. It thinks it's clever. It's not. It thinks it's cool. And it's not. It's just a desperate, juddering see through imitation of a film it's impossible to be in the mood for. *",2/10
Bullet Train (2022),"It's clear a film is less than successful when an added scene pops up one or two minutes into the credits, and, rather than pausing to watch, the audience quickly glances up then resumes their escape from the auditorium as quickly as possible.This film felt like it ran for days on end. It reminded me of a dinner we had in a tourist restaurant in Morocco where the courses kept coming and coming until we began to despair. And yet on it went...just look like this movie.There was clearly a fair amount of technical talent that went into this turkey, but creative inspiration was noticeably absent. Instead of anything original, the viewer is subjected to an endless stream of sub-Tarantino and sub-Guy Ritchie guff that someone apparently thought was clever. Even cameos from Channing Tatum and a painfully face-lifted Sandra Bullock add zero to the experience.In sum, this expensive fiasco is like an evening gown that incorporates $10,000 worth of material in a design by a JC Penney junior assistant: gaudy, vulgar and a colossal misfire.",5/10

As Fast as bullet Train, the aura was as smoky and sexy as the actors, the screenplay was as rushing as the adrenaline in my veins, and the song selection was as catchy as possible...This movie had everything that was unexpected from it.I especially loved tangerine & lemon - couldn't get enough of their bantering (who should have their own spin off film/tv series). I love that they dove deep into each character and showed us their past so we understand how they became the way they are today as well as why they take certain actions and decisions.

The writers must've thought that ripping off far superior movies would make the viewer associate this laughable dumpster fire with them and therefore produce a small subliminal dopamine hit. They were wrong, Bullet Train just looks plain bad by comparison. We have the usual tropes, the hit man working through his ""issues"", a pair of cockney geezers talking bollocks about Thomas the Tank Engine, the deadly female assassin dressed as a school girl and psychotic Russian gangsters. These characters are meant to be quirky and entertaining, they are boring and anoying. The fight choreography is terrible, the dialogue excruciating, the CGI diabolical and the acting atrocious.

The Fabelmans (2022),"The Fabelmans
I have been interested in this film since the moment I heard about it. As a kid whose first memorable movie theater experience was E. T., no filmmaker has more influenced the way I experience movies than Spielberg...and nothing influenced those movies more than his parents' divorce. So I was 100% ready for a personal tale, an origin story without capes or superpowers. No CGI. No motion capture. Just a movie about the power of families and stories through the eyes of a kid. It is just that... But it is more too. There's a generosity in the way that Spielberg makes sense of his own story after the fact. Nobody is a villain or hero. They are just people choosing between happiness and responsibility while realizing slowly and painfully that it may not have to be either/or. There were scenes that worked better than others (and I am still sorting through the third act), but it was fun to see him tell a story like this, whether it was his own or not.",8/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"This semi-autobiographical film centres around Sammy Fabelman who is transfixed by the first movie he sees at age 6 and develops a passion for film making. Other themes explored with variable depth and success include the fracturing marriage of his parents, bullying and anti-semitism at high school, young love and coming of age, and selfishness in general.The movie is way too long and felt a little boring in the first 45minutes. It's nicely shot and well directed as you would expect, but the script is patchy and while the acting is generally excellent, the performances of Paul Dano and in particular Michelle Williams as Sammy's parents felt too affected and a little contrived - at times I felt I was watching filming on the set of a TV sitcom. I wonder still if this was deliberately instructed by Spielberg, but for me it doesn't work.Gabriel Labelle is the best as the teenage Sammy and Judd Hirsch is superb in a cameo as Uncle Boris. John Williams as always provides a perfect score and the visuals are superb.Overall it's worth seeing for a little insight into Spielberg's childhood but there is an unsatisfactory feel to the film as a whole. I think it could have been so much better.",7/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"It's watching Steven Spielberg grow up from a child terrified by the train crash in THE GREATEST SHOW ON EARTH, to an adolescent film maker. He's pretty up front about the family issues and his parents' break up. I suspect he has realized that being an adult is a tough thing and is willing to forgive.At 150 minutes, it should feel self indulgent, but it never does, thanks to a terrific performance by Michelle Williams as the mother and Paul Dano as the father. No one seems to be acting, which is half the Spielberg magic. There are also great cameos by Judd Hirsch as the profane uncle who was a lion tamer, and David Lynch as John Ford.Some of the characters seem sketchily drawn, particularly the sisters, but that serves to emphasize Miss Williams, Dano, and Gabriel LaBelle as the Steven Spielberg character. Is she t that Spielberg and his frequent collaborator Tony Kühner, have drawn a fine portrait of a Jewish post-war family, when things were supposed to be so very bland... but really, people were living their lives.",8/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"This felt more like a revenge film targeting ""Bennie"" and Spielberg's high school bully ""Logan"" - characters names that have been changed to protect the real identity of those who may otherwise had legal slander recourse, had their real names been used. I'm even willing to bet Spielberg specifically cast actors that looked like his nemesis, just to spite them even more. Then we get a story of those that deprived him of a normal childhood, instead of those that inspired him. I still have no further knowledge of what made Spielberg a great filmmaker. The entire first 90 mins was utter boredom of a typical dysfunctional family - all just shallow filler, and the remaining 1 hour was just another high school drama story playing out, with very little substance. What the heck are all these critics raving about... there was nothing brilliant in this dull, bland, self-indulgent shallow slog. I learned more about Spielberg's mom than him. This is literally the most boring Spielberg film I've ever seen, and for that matter, a film no one should care about. Even the screenplay was riddled with unnecessary subplots that had more plot holes than engaging narrative. Granted, the dated set pieces and wardrobe were on point, and all casting and performances spot-on, and the score was perfect. But none of that matters when you're forced to sit through a two and a half hour film that leaves you frustrated and unsatisfied. It's amusing how another great filmmaker, James Cameron, gives us Avatar 2, and Spielberg gives us this nonsense vanity project. You can tell one is falling from grace and the other rising past. It's a very generous 5/10 from me.",5/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"'The Fabelmans' is not good. Director and Co-Writer Steven Spielberg's heart was in the right place (the idea, the conceit, the structure is fine), but the execution fails to deliver. The film is too long by far, scenes run on forever, the story seems flabby and unfocused (and yes, that includes the hero's undying desire to become a film-maker).Here's what I believe Spielberg was attempting.(1) He is presenting the story of HIS life; how he (Spielberg) became the world famous film director.(2) In doing so, he portrays different periods of his life as though each were a different genre of movie. (a) The film's opening plays like a 50s family sitcom, complete with the goofy next-door neighbor. (b) A visit from an uncle plays like a horror film. (c) Adolescence is a 'Beach Blanket' movie with Frankie Avalon and Annette Funicello, at other times a 'Blackboard Jungle' of bigoted and roughneck bullies. (d) We've got 'OZ's' Yellow Brick Road of a finale, preceded by 'OZ's' Dorothy / Spielberg meeting with the wizard himself and receiving his advice. (e) Add to this 'The Conversation' / 'Blow Out' / 'Blow Up' fascination with studying taped video and or audio, inch by inch, in order to fully understand what is actually taking place.(3) Now the use of film genres in this way could be a very satisfying. It would tell us that Spielberg always viewed his life, while living it, as a movie. And it might have worked were the film less talky, better written (the dialogue is awful), and faster paced. And perhaps better shot. There is something flat up there on the screen; nearly every scene feels like the one before and the one that follows. I can't say why. It just does.I wish I'd liked the film. As a big fan of Spielberg's earlier work, I had strong rooting interest for him to meet his usual high standard.And it's likely you do too. And as such you might well look past my criticisms of the film; might hold him to a less lofty standard.You might well enjoy it.I imagine that many viewers will.",2/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"... with a very central horizon, albeit with a rather successful director revealing his grounding, but you've seen it many times before, watching other people grow up's such a chore, we've all been adolescent, distracted and pubescent, it's a boring set of takes and you will snore. Perhaps if it had something new to say, portrayed a family more uniquely in their way, a novel circumstance, to catch your eye, a second glance, not monotony of people day to day. If you make it to the end you might just wonder, why fine actors chose to loot your time and plunder (I'll give you three guesses but you only need one), must be quite a fallow year, to want to make this and appear, in something that's so dull, it makes you want to slumber.",5/10
The Fabelmans (2022),I can't shake the fact that there is something very pompous about Steven Spielberg making a fictional movie about his real life. It does not help that I first herd of this film after watching a documentary on HBO called Spielberg in which Steve and his family tell the same story as the Fabelmans. It's not like the movie Crooklyn which is a Spike Lee joint about Spike Lee and his family. I think it hits me as arrogant because we know from the jump Sammy Fabelman is Spielberg cause from the jump its all about Sammy making films.It's a great movie for artist because it's all about the love of the art and your wiliness to sacrifice for that art. It's also for those who are stuck or feel stuck because they feel unable to truly express themselves. A fantastic coming of Age story about a man who could not do anything else but follow his dreams.It makes you wonder weather Spielberg's upbringing was that interesting or is Spielberg soooo good at telling a story that he could make anyone's life look interesting? A little bit of both but with his streak of great stories including this one I have to lean or towards the latter.,9/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"As ""The Fabelmans"" (2022 release; 150 min.) opens, it is ""January 10, 1952"" and 6 yo Steven, urrr I mean Sammy, needs some serious convincing by his parents to go see ""The Greatest Show On Earth"", but when he does, he is overwhelmed. He wants to recreate the train wreck from the movie, and it's his mom who suggests filming it on an 8mm camera... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie.Couple of comments: this is Steven Spielberg's long-awaited film of his youth. I love and respect Spielberg, but this is Spielberg at his worst: sentimental and self-indulgent. There isn't a single aspect of the movie that I found interesting or redeeming. Why did Spielberg assume that his family's comings and goings, including his parents' marital challenges, would be so unique and hence interesting, when in fact this is what happened to millions and millions of families in the 50s and early 60s. As a complete aside, as most of you know Spielberg lived in Cincinnati until age 11, then moved to Phoenix. A significant early part of the movie plays out in Cincinnati, but there is not a single reference, none, to Cincinnati. Why? In contrast, the second that the family is moving to Phoenix, Arizona, the area is mentioned multiple times in the film. I find it curious, to say the least.""The Fabelmans"" premiered at last Fall's Toronto International Film Festival to immediate critical acclaim and then was released in US theaters just before Thanksgiving. Since then it has significantly underperformed at the box office (a mere $12 million after 7 weeks). The matinee screening where I saw this at the day after New Year's at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati was attended well (I counted roughly 30 people). I honestly cannot think of any movie by Spielberg that is worse than this, and I cannot in good conscience recommend this to anyone. If you haven't seen this yet, please save yourself the time and money. You'll thank me later when you catch it streaming at some point.",3/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"Hollywood likes to make movies about Hollywood. Several of the great directors (including
Spielberg's friends and collaborators Truffaut and George Lucas) have made autobiographical films inspired by their own childhood and adolescence. In 'The Fabelmans' (2022), Steven Spielberg combines the two genres and the result can only be a film that pleases the public as well as the members of the Academy. In fact, it's the film that will have to be beaten in several important categories in this year's Academy Awards competition. But I don't think it was an easy film for Spielberg. It's not easy to make a film where the main characters are your parents and yourself at the ages of childhood and adolescence. Anyone who has read a biography of Spielberg will recognize the characters, years and dates of the main events depicted in the film as belonging to the first 19 years of Spielberg's life. Without being a masterpiece and even if it brings back to the screen some of the strengths and weaknesses of the director's previous films, 'The Fabelmans' is a film full of emotion and above all of love for cinema and fascination for the power of the image.The opening and closing scenes of 'The Fabelmans' are probably either fiction or much improved history (the screenplay is written by Spielberg in collaboration with Tony Kushner). In the first scene, a six-year-old boy is taken by his parents to the cinema for the first time. He is a bit afraid of the 'big people on the screen'. Father explaines to him scientifically how moving images are formed. Mother tells him about emotions. He will see a film by Cecil B. DeMille in which a spectacular catastrophe occurs - the collision between two trains and an automobile caught in the middle between them. The impression is strong: fear and fascination. In the final scene of 'The Fabelmans' the same character, now a 19-year-old who wants nothing else in life than to make films, has the privilege of chatting for a few minutes with 'the greatest director who ever lived', John Ford ( played brilliantly by David Lynch). In a few sentences he gives him a lesson that sums up the art of the visual and that also symbolizes a passing of the baton between generations and eras of American cinema. Between these two scenes we are dealing with the story of the childhood and adolescence of a boy who becomes fascinated by the camera and who gradually learns not only the secrets of its handling but also the power that the one who films and edits acquires - the power to tell stories , to create characters and embellish real characters, to envelop his viewers in dreams and nightmares, to document the truth or hide it by cutting at the editing table.What we have in the two and a half hours between these two scenes is the story of an American family after World War II. Father, mother, four children of whom Sam Fabelman is the oldest and only boy. It looks like a model family, but in reality it is an unhappy family in its own way ((C) Tolstoy). Mother, father and Sam are three strong characters with aspirations in different directions who cannot be all three happy at the same time. The father is presented as a brilliant scientist, one of those whose vision and technical talent ushered in the era of numerical computers. He is an extremely good man but absorbed in work. He supports his family and their ever-increasing standard of living, but to succeed everything must be sacrificed to his career - including marriage and family life. Mother had been a talented pianist, but the obligations of supporting a household with three or four children had forced her to give up her career as a professional musician. Finally, Sam becomes more and more overwhelmed by his passion for cinema, encouraged, sometimes secretly by his mother, while his father continues for a long time to consider it just a hobby. The camera was for Sam a moral support, a refuge, a way to express his feelings and to ward off the blows caused by the conflicts of the outside world: the changes of residence increasingly westward in the United States to California, following the father's career, the anti-Semitic violence he suffers from some of his new colleagues, and especially the breakup of his parents' marriage.We have in this film an updated version of that Spielberg of the films where he focuses on the characters with their dramas and melodramas and does not resort to spectacular effects. The casting is, as always, excellent, emphasizing the ability to create emotion. Paul Dano as the father is amazing, one of the best fleshed out characters I've seen in movies lately. Michelle Williams sometimes thickens and repeats features of the mother's character, but she, too, I think, will not avoid at least an Academy Award nomination. Seth Rogers (almost unrecognizable) and Judd Hirsch pencil two key supporting roles. Gabriel LaBelle is cast in the lead role of Sam, who I think I'm seeing for the first time. He is surrounded by a group of young and talented actors who play the hero's classmates, friends, sisters and girlfriend, all in their childhood and teenage years. Spielberg is, as always, excellent in casting and directing child, adolescent or young actors. There are some aspects that are covered in less depth - such as the Jewishness of the hero and his family. Perhaps Spielberg will address this theme in one of his future films. 'The Fabelmans' will remain in the memory of the viewers as a story of love and fascination between a teenager and the camera. A director is born before our eyes. The last frame, a la Chaplin or The Wizard of Oz, is actually just the beginning.",8/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"The Fabelmans is very worthy of Oscar nominations the acting throughout was one of the best ever! The family dynamic was so sweet and I wish could be a filmmaker or work on movies in some aspect like Sam's character which I'm pretty sure was based on Steven Spielbergs life. I absolutely loved everything about the movie only hard thing is the length even that is worth it. Packed with great emotions, how to make movies, tender moments, perfect humor, cinematic scenery, and brilliant acted scenes that electrified me! I'm proud of Seth Rogen being involved in serious roles where as the bulk of his roles were raunchy or less serious. All around wonderful film for anyone to enjoy.",10/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"After 50 years of making movies, Steven Spielberg is still, in the 2020s, finding new muscles to work. His semi-autobiopic, The Fabelmans, is different in style, reach, and aim, than anything Spielberg has ever made. The consummate ringmaster has never helmed a film so modest. And for a director whose personal attachments are spread all over his filmography, The Fabelmans may also be his most intimate.The story of Sam Fabelman (Gabriel LaBelle) is the story of Steven Spielberg, Jewish kid from Small Town USA, lover and later maker of movies. Sam shares with Steven three younger sisters, an eccentric concert pianist mother, an electrical engineer father, and a nearly identical path to movie directing. The names might be different, but obviously The Fabelmans is a dramatization of Steven Spielberg's childhood. It's certainly not our first indication of what the director thinks of such things as his parents' divorce, his interpersonal relationships with his family, or the images, moments, and memories that inspired him to make movies. Spielberg has brilliantly disguised these themes within his genre films; in alien invasion movies, dinosaur pictures, science fiction noirs, and family fantasy adventures. But with The Fabelmans, here comes the full reveal. It is a movie directly about family. His family. One must assume The Fabelmans is Steven Spielberg's last word on the subjects that have bewitched him throughout his career.The Fabelmans is kitchen sink drama all the way; no bells, no whistles, no magic realism or distracting style. In other words, no distance from these characters. The ones we have here are all quite well-realized. Paul Dano as Burt, the Fableman patriarch, is a sweetheart; surprisingly real despite an affected subservient speech pattern. Dano's character could have been an embarrassing caricature of the ""no fun, get a job"" father, but he comes out well-intentioned and completely three dimensional in a thankless role. Michelle Williams has the showier job playing mother Mitzy. She doesn't fumble the challenge, and in fact carves out a memorable personality from the more artistically inclined of Sam's parents. In the middle is Gabriel LaBelle, the latest model of the square-jawed, brown-eyed, young male muse that Spielberg has been searching for for decades now. Like Ansel Elgort, Tye Sheridan, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jeremy Irvine, and Shia LaBeouf before him (the man has a type), he's good enough. LaBelle is a likeable personality, a truly important metric for a performance like this, and he anchors the film admirably. Will it be that elusive star-making performance Spielberg has clearly been wanting from one of his young proteges? No. But it's a nice one.A few supporting players stop in for extended cameos. Judd Hirsh's quick turn as Uncle Boris may very well earn him an Oscar nomination. Hirsch has the classic showpiece monologue-two of them to be exact-and the sort of built-up respect needed for such a role. Young Chloe East on the other hand is a real discovery as Sam's high school girlfriend. Just when the movie needs a little energy, she comes in with the good stuff. Her's is a bright and living performance that never feels put on. Seth Rogan is there as well. A risky, maybe inspired casting choice, he's not bad.The Fabelmans is practically structureless, even at times aimless. There is no agreed-upon thesis that the movie is working toward, nor is there a feeling Spielberg is coaxing us into experiencing. As a cinematic project, it does not play to its director's strengths whatsoever. But we've seen the resiliency of Steven Spielberg before. Desert animal he truly is; able to adapt to changing landscapes and external challenges. By his standards, this is a tiny movie. Not the first quiet, artistic coming-of-age movie (in one of the movie's few missteps, it trots out a clichéd bullying subplot that drags the quality of the production way down), but in experienced, versatile hands, one of the very best.The Fabelmans certainly won't blow the doors off the box office, and for many, its sincere love for the craft of filmmaking will go completely unregistered. That narrow appeal, however, is precisely why The Fabelmans is destined to become a very special movie for people like me. I had my own 'Greatest Show on Earth' experience at six years old, when I saw Sam Raimi's Spider-man in one of the great big theaters where my aunt lived. Later, after I had discovered more of my favorites, developed a taste for the movies, I made my own. My cousins starred in one Jurassic Park rip-off as a team of scientists pursued by dragons in Shanghai. I became a film snob in college, and made short films with the guiding help of a professor who thought I had potential. I got a job as a documentarian and later directed a commercial or two of my own. All the while, I had my own family, who happen to be a lot like The Fabelmans, there to support and sometimes to trivialize, but whom I love with everything I have. Oh, it is sappy to talk about how personal The Fabelmans feels to me. I'm sure mine will not be the only review emphasizing how relatable this film is to someone with the artistic itch. But I assume I'm much like Sam Fabelman, and Steven Spielberg too, when I say that movies are my therapy. Our careers may never compare, but at least we'll share that.Mazal Tov.87/100.",8/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"Steven Spielbergs semi autobiography. This is his love letter to cinema. This is one of the legendary filmmaker trying to show us how he fell in love with cinema in the first place. Once i watched this movie I just wanted to take a camera, go out and just start filming something, that's how heartwarming it is. The movie mainly is a coming of age story. Any aspiring filmmaker or anyone who loves cinema for that matter will love this movie. There is some exceptionally staged and shot moments in the movie, for example there is this scene where sammy (the protagonist) realises his mom is having an affair with his dads best friend. The way they show that scene is just amazing. The scenes where he try to shoot a movie with his friends and the techniques he uses to show a gun firing Or shoot a war sequence were just amazing. The movie also tries to show a family drama, sammys relationship with his parents and sisters and how they deal with the divorce of their parents. Gabriel La Belle is just amazing as sammy. I really liked his performance. Michelle Williams, seth rogans, paul dano all gave amazing performance. The girls who came as sammys sisters were amazing. The movie is technically awsome. Kaminskis cinematography is so awsome, the retro effect, the nostalgia just hits you and gives such a nice vibe.",8/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"The movie ""The Fabelmans"" is the worst film directed by Steven Spielberg so far. I am not sure if it was intentional but the film looks amateurish and not made by the incredible director.The movie is very poorly written, with childish and sometimes incoherent lines. And worst of all, are the performances, perhaps due to the script. Michelle Williams over-performed Mitzi Fabelman, the matriarch, and Seth Rogen as Bennie Loewy seem like a robot reading a manuscript. Even the plot inspired by some facts from Spielberg's childhood is conventional: the boy who likes to film the family's activities, the boy who is bullied in school, and a secret in the family.If Spielberg wanted to pay homage to cinema, he failed miserably. The only scene that deserves attention is the final 10 minutes. If you want to experiment the influence cinema in someone's life watch ""Cinema Paradiso"" or ""The Purple Rose of Cairo""",3/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"When Kenneth Branagh made the semi autobiographical Belfast. His childhood nostalgia of happier times was punctured by the all too real bombs and the bullet.Civil war had broken out on his doorstep. The Branagh family eventually moved to England.Steven Spielberg seems to be clueless with the overlong semi autobiographical The Fablemans. So much so, I wondered why he decided that people would be interested in his life story.Technically well made, this is the worse performing Spielberg film at the box office.There is a good reason for it, this is a bad film and I'm a fan of Spielberg!Starting off in 1952, young Sammy goes to see his first movie with his parents. It is The Greatest Show on Earth. Shocked and dazed by the experience, he wants to recreate the train crash scene and starts his journey as a budding filmmaker.His father Burt (Paul Dano) a scientist thinks Sammy is just going through a phase of making movies that he will eventually grow out of. Mother Mitzi is an artistic free spirit. 'Uncle' Bennie Loewy (Seth Rogen) is a family friend and work colleague of Burt who keeps hanging around the house.Because of Burt's work in the developing tech industry. The family move around a lot. The teenage Sammy ends up in California. Where he encounters anti semitic, bullying and eventually finding romance with a devout Christian who dumps him at their prom night.The move to California also makes his mother unhappy and leads to a schism in family relationships.The Fablemans has no idea what it wants to be. Is is about the early life of one of the movie greats? A tribute to his parents despite them drifting apart?If the early part of the movie was cloying sentimentality. The Californian segment turns into a typical nerdy high school drama.The only jolting originality being the late appearance of David Lynch playing director John Ford.Spielberg co-wrote the movie and lost his sure touch as the project was just too personal. Even the audience would be ahead of Spielberg, when Mitzi insists that Burt gets Bennie a job as well when he is hired by another company.The Fablemans was nominated for the Best Picture Oscar, an accolade denied to his film from 1987, Empire of the Sun. The latter was miles better.",4/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"It's 1952 New Jersey. Mitzi Fabelman (Michelle Williams) and Burt Fabelman (Paul Dano) bring their son Sammy to his first movie, The Greatest Show on Earth.

Friend Uncle Bennie Loewy (Seth Rogen) works under Burt and is a constant fixture around the family.This is a semi-autobiography by Steven Spielberg. It's fine as a childhood recollection. Spielberg has the cinematic skills to create another one of his childhood adventure. Except, the adventure is his life. It is elevated by Williams and Dano's performances. They don't miss a beat. There is a noticeable barrier to the material and his parents. The story is told from a child's point of view. His parents remain somewhat above him. At the end of the day, none of us can ever be more than a child to our parents.",8/10

The camera angles are great pf course. But its just so boring and just silly.Seems Stephen wants to make a movie about himself so people will believe he is really like that kid in the movie.

The Fabelmans (2022),"Steven Spielberg, two Golden Globes awards plus other nominees, a high rating on here, all ingredients for a good movie night. But the truth is that it had a lot of negative things about it. First of all it was way too long, you could have skipped the first half of the movie, boring is an understatement for that part. Watching actors playing happy family combined with awful piano music for an entire hour got me almost sleeping. Luckily the second part had a couple interesting scenes but that couldn't save this overrated movie. If this was autobiographical from Spielberg I can only conclude it was a rather boring growing up for him. He made some good movies but this one isn't one of them.",5/10
The Fabelmans (2022),I cannot believe this movie has this high of a rating. I must not have watched the same movie. It was agonizingly boring. Michelle Williams looks weird the entire movie. The story really went nowhere. I was ready leave 20 minutes in and it absolutely did not get any better.Don't waste your time or money seeing this movie. There are very few redeeming qualities.People are scared to say the movie is trash because it's Spielberg. It was so bad.Movie could have been straight to dvd. There is no need to see it I'm theaters.I'm am in complete shock this movie is highly rated. It should not win any awards.Top 10 worst movie I've ever seen.,3/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"So there is this ordinary kid living an ordinary life and all the tragedy is everyday tragedy most people live and they are actually hardly a tragedy. It's just everyday bad situations and that's it. Nothing interesting and fun thing in this movie at all.On the top of it why this movie had to be so long? You can easily make it an hour if you cut all scenes short.To be honest if I knew Seth Rogen was in this movie I wouldn't watch it because as I figured every movie he is a part of shouldn't be taken seriously especially when the movie shouldn't be a comedy.The kid's family doesn't seem like your ordinary family. I thought they are Nobel prized scientists on anything related to human minds and all for their extreme knowledge on psychology even though it was 1950s so it was like they are just an ordinary American family from 2022 but the mother was just a pianist and the father is a computer engineer LOL.I have no idea what would make sense about the tornado scene. It seemed like it was put to cause a sense of big deal stuff going on and as every scene of this movie that scene was also a boring dead end.I have no idea what the message the director tried to give but what I understood is ""you can develop a bad movie no matter the budget"" LMAO.",1/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"Many years ago, Steven Spielberg conceived the idea of the movie based on the story of his family and growing up in various states, cities, and towns across the US. By his own admission, he has told the parts of the story in many of his films. For a long time, he could not come to terms with his parents' divorce when he was a teenager and for many years, he blamed his father and almost did not communicate with him. Over time, he learned details that he did not suspect, and in the last years of his parents' life, he was close to both. Both of his parents lived to a ripe old age. His mother died at 97 and his father at 103. While himself in his 70s he was blessed to be a son of two loving living parents. After their death, he finally decided to tell the story about them, about his childhood and adolescence, about the origins of his love for cinema, the love that became his calling, profession, and obsession for life.The Fabelmans is Steven Spielberg's most personal and touching film. It is his Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Amarcord, the New Paradiso Cinema, Radio Days, and The Mirror. While the themes of adolescence and becoming a creative person are similar in these very personal films of the great directors, The Fabelmans is unmistakably a film that only Spielberg, an artist at the peak of his talent and vision, could conceive, write, feel and stage. It is a dedication to the main tool of the filmmaker, his camera, to power and magic with which it entertains, delights, opens up new dimensions, stops moments, and highlights the unexpected essence of things, but can also break hearts and lives. Manipulating the camera shots and angles, Spielberg achieves in the best scenes of his semi-biographical movie the Rashomon's effect and opens his soul to the viewer in a way he has never done before. By the power of his talent, its creator captured the important, happy, and painful moments of the search for meaning and put them on screen as a compelling family portrait. Such sincerity and frankness will be appreciated by the viewer, who is ready to accept them. But the same sincerity and frankness can cause bewilderment, misunderstanding, and even rejection. Spielberg must have known about it, but he had to make the movie anyway. In my opinion, The Fabelmans is an honest, beautiful, and memorable film.",9/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"Magical Egotism is the current vogue in American non-franchise moviedom. Leading practitioners are David O. Russell, Richard Linklater, Noah Baumbach....and now the old hit-maker Steven Spielberg proves himself a master of the genre. This blancmange of a film is redeemed in part by Michelle Williams' remarkable performance and an all-too-brief one by Judd Hirsch. Otherwise, it's tooth-rot.Spielberg's great talent is for genre movies, so he should be on firm ground here. But the sad fact is that any time he touches anything even remotely serious, there is a whiff of fakery that, in some of his work, becomes a stench.It's some irony that in this movie, his alter-ego Sam Fableman assesses his early attempt at an 8mm adventure as 'Fake!'. That is THE FABLEMANS.",1/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"I was so wanting to love this, Spielberg hasn't done a decent movie in a long time so I was really rooting for this but it's a sappy soggy saggy slush through a gauze filtered revision. The story if one can call it that just rambles with mind bending cringe lines. Stories happen to people who can tell them. Worst dialogue heard in theaters since the 90s. This will do well in streaming but I would advise against spending money in a ticket. You'll feel like you just paid movie theater money to watch a lifetime movie you could have watched on your living room couch for a lot less money. Biggest problem is that the story isn't that interesting or compelling.",2/10
The Fabelmans (2022),"While Michelle Williams and Paul Dano are gifted actors, there's not much they can do to save an overly long and boring movie. Easily 45 minutes could have been cut from this 2.5 hour flick. I just don't think it was necessary to see every film Spielberg made as a child. The antisemitism in California was interesting, but the rest was a snore. I was supposed to feel sorry for the mother and think her creativity was smothered, but she sure got to do what she wanted. What was the lesson for Spielberg about that? The three sisters were cardboard cutouts and never developed. Os this movie his story or his parents' story as neither happens effectively. If this is nominated for awards, then Hollywood really has lost its way.",4/10

We love you, Mr. Lynch.So, ""The Fabelmans"" is a feel-good movie which aims for family values, and most of all; the message that ""dreams come true"".",8/10

Delightful in that Spielbergian way in which he manages to create scenes that are equal parts poignant and comical. Beautifully shot and scored, and perfectly cast, with standout performances by Michelle and Gabriel. While it is deeply personal for Spielberg, it is relatable in so many ways, with family being one of the central themes. Having studied film, I just enjoyed watching how this legendary filmmaker showed us his journey IN filmmaking in the context of his own life and upbringing. A movie for movie lovers BY one of the biggest movie lovers of all time.",9/10
The Woman King (2022),"The trailer for ""The Woman King"" would have you believe that the film is one constant, nonstop action romp. Alas, you have been misled! But what else are Hollywood marketing departments for than to trick potential viewers. More of a talky drama and less of an action extravaganza, ""The Woman King"" tells a revisionist, alternative history of the fierce Dahomey kingdom. I am no historian, so, when walking into this movie, I knew literally zero of whatever the true story may be; instead, I simply desired a film with an engaging plot, and well-shot action sequences. ""The Woman King"" has none of those to offer.For a film that advertises the brutality of its characters, ""The Woman King"" is surprisingly bloodless. With action scenes filmed in the typical close-up shaky camera style, this movie, in terms of its action, offers up nothing that you haven't already seen before, and seen done better. During large-scale battles the camera shakes, as if the cameraman himself is having a seizure; the violence is censored and neutered, with a lot of the kills occurring offscreen - because a movie about slavery just has to be dumbed down to PG-13 to become family friendly! Film is a business, after all.Luckily, you will find some entertainment value - or at least I did - when viewing the culture of the Dahomey tribe. I can't speak to the historical accuracy of what the film portrayed, but I do enjoy movies that show in such detail the culture of people who lived long ago, so I certainly enjoyed the various traditions and rituals that were shown on screen. Alas, I do have a complaint when it comes to this, though: What I thought would be my favorite part of the film, the military training, almost seemed like an afterthought with it taking up only a small amount of screen time. What, then, did the film focus on? Mediocre melodrama.With actresses that act so well you wonder if they were preordained for success in the film industry, ""The Woman King"" boasts Viola Davis and Lashana Lynch, two women who consistently give powerhouse performances. And while their performances are well done in this movie, the problem lies in the fact that ""The Woman King"" has a weak script. Instead of telling a straightforward story about fighting back against slavers, for some reason the movie decides to add plot threads (including an underwritten and unbelievable romance) that I, frankly, didn't care about. So while I enjoyed the acting, I couldn't help but feel taken out of and bored with the movie since the storylines never really grabbed me - a lot of it felt like it was taken out of a comic book or graphic novel, complete with a revenge subplot that was borderline unnecessary in a movie that was already about seeking revenge against those who have enslaved them.A crowd pleaser through and through, ""The Woman King"" is receiving both critical and general audience acclaim; with an A+ rating on Cinemascore, I'm sure that most will walk into and enjoy it for the historical epic that it is. However, the bloated plot, weak script, and worst of all, the watered down, unfulfilling, and incomprehensible action kept me from fully finding entertainment value in this movie because, as I often say, when the action in your action movie sucks, your movie sucks. And while ""The Woman King"" doesn't suck, it's not nearly as good as it would have you believe.",5/10
The Woman King (2022),"Started well and ended well. Nothing in between. No story. Awfully slow-paced. You won't miss anything, can be skipped. There were some good acting and strong women
with good fight stunts. But, the story was poorly written with too many dragged scenes and with only two to three fight scenes. There is no proper direction and the background score doesn't even exist. Screenplay & Editing was just awful. Trailer tried to hype a bit. Other than the shots in the trailer, there is nothing much in the movie. Could have done much better with characters and more war scenes. Nothing interesting at any point.",4/10
The Woman King (2022),"I saw the two glowing reviews here and decided to write mine. I watched the movie today at the cinema and I was left with a slight feeling of disappointment.First off, the story is engaging and the the plot progression isn't bad. But something just felt missing.The trailer is a bit misleading but I won't spoil anything here.Let me start with the bad; the title gives the impression that Viola Davis is the central character but this is not so from what I saw, not really.Thuso Mbedu's character seems to be the protagonist here and her delivery is nothing short of amazing.Lashana Lynch is equally phenomenal as a supporting character, even outshining Davis.As for John Boyega, his outing as the young king is one or the best things about this film. I didn't know the actor had such charisma.Generally, the acting is good, especially from the aforementioned actors.Nigerian born actor Jimmy Odukoya is a great villain who wasn't given enough screentime.I believe the character would have been phenomenal if his backstory had been explored.The cinematography is below par (I have seen Nollywood movies with better camera work) but perhaps the biggest letdown is the action.The fight sequences came off as really disappointing as it was easy to see that it wasn't real combat despite the impressive choreography.The romance was forced and written in such a way that at the end of it all, I asked myself why it was there in the first place.The musical score is sublime and the songs and chants got my attention.At the risk of being bashed, I will end my review by saying The Woman King is a good movie that should have and could have been far more.",5/10
The Woman King (2022),"The Woman King (2022) is a movie my wife and I caught in theatres last night. The storyline follows an African kingdom with a new(er) king in 1823 who posses the only female army in Africa. The leader of the female Army has a past that haunts her but the respect of her king, enough to be on his council. She strongly urges him to avoid the slave trade and find alternative methods of riches. Meanwhile, those who do believe strongly in the slave trade look to march on the kingdom and bring them down. A new recruitment class to the female army brings brashness, new ideas to defend the kingdom, and the female leader's ghosts back to the forefront...This movie is directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love & Basketball) and stars Viola Davis (The Help), Thuso Mbedu (The Underground Railroad), Lashana Lynch (No Time to Die), Sheila Atim (Doctor Strange: In the Mouth of Madness), John Boyega (Star Wars: Episode VII-IV) and Jimmy Odukoya (Mamba's Diamond).This movie has so much depth and contains a great primary plot and even better sub plots. The writing is remarkable, thorough and very impressive. The character's inner demons are well portrayed as is their struggle to overcome them. The acting is out of this world across the board. You feel for every character; and if anything happens to anyone, you feel personally hurt. The villains were also excellent as is the outcome of each of them. The settings and cinematography is outstanding and there is impressive use of lighting. The action scenes are remarkable and the fight choreography is award winning caliber. My only complaint is an awkward love story that is obviously in here to show maturity and self discovery but I could have done without it.Overall, this movie has literally everything you'd want in a movie - tremendous action, great villains, self discovery and character triumph. I would strongly, strongly recommend seeing this movie and score it a 10/10. We loved it.",10/10
The Woman King (2022),"LIKES:The Plot: A plot like this has the potential to be too extreme or get lost in one factor that everything else tumbles. Thankfully, The Woman King has succeeded on many fronts with a successful presentation. While nothing revolutionary that we haven't seen before, this film really takes a tired story and sharpens it into a spear of many elements that pulled me into the mix. The battle for slavery in the colony days holds many horrors and the movie really shows how one can make a film about fighting the horrors without going Disney on it. Amidst the overall plot are various subplots that focus on the kingdom aspect, which though not fully fleshed out like Game of Thrones, again holds great management with the time they have, establishing a good pace. It forges a community quite well, and that is the central pillar for this film to work with.The Character Focus/Utilization: Much of the story's strength comes from the fantastic character focus of the story, and utilizing many people in the right amounts. True, Viola Davis is a main character, but the writers and director managed to extend the stories to other warriors that help give you more characters to attach too. Outside the woman warrior components, other factions hold their own merit, such as the King himself by Boyega, the evil ruler of the opposing empire, and even the love interest that forms later on in the movie. While not the most balanced, it again, keeps the components very well involved and helps spice up the tale we've heard so much.The Cultural Aspect: Taking those characters and throwing them into a cultural tale was a brilliant choice for me. The Woman King will give you plenty of tribal activities to study and adore, finding themselves potentially captivated by the community's use of song, dance, chanting, and other rituals. Some might be hard, boring, or boastful, I'll admit that when they get a little long, but overall, very impressed with the cultural integration piece to establish the setting.The Music: Another immersive element, this movie's film score holds two primary styles that might help get you into the setting they designed. No surprise, there is a lot of what sounds like African Tribal music to the works, the drums, shakers, and a few horns helping to give you that stereotypical sound the Lion King made famous for many of us. It works very well in the cultural settings and sometimes extends to other moments that describe the pain well. My favorite was the orchestral work, and there are moments where the theater's system amplify that sound to a very, very, high degree to sell that epic moment. Great use of music.The Acting: No surprise, the movie has done very well to make the characters come to life in ways I had hoped they would. Not quite in your face feminist and tough, as many things choose to do, this tribe kicks major butt in the female led cast. Lynch is probably one of my favorite characters in this story, her balance is nice to see, and she shows so much in her ability to extend across emotional spectra to make a very realistic character. Young actress Mbedu crushed her role as well, getting a lot more spotlight than I had anticipated, but for the most part gets her acting down pat, including hysterical cries. I quite enjoyed her determination, but again the fact that she was not perfect was an incredible display of direction and restraint to again make fun characters. Of course, Davis is the star of the show and no surprise, she crushes it again. In what might be my favorite role of hers, at least in a while, Davis unleashes the tough woman attitude she wields so well, but then manages to pull some it back and open up her vulnerability. As the movie goes on, she may not cover quite as many levels of emotion her compatriots do, but somehow takes her angle and makes it work so well given the position of her character. Needless to say, but I will anyway, the chemistry is top notch and that's the successful part of all this ordeal is how well they work together.The Costumes/Make Up: We aren't turning the women into orcs, elves, or donkeys, but they are transforming them into the tribal warriors of a kingdom. This film's use of costume and makeup is subtle, looking like something from a play, but again works so well in what it accomplishes. I loved the warrior looks, I loved the settlers rugged clothes showing struggle, but entitlement, and I loved the makeup evolution deepening on the scene as it brought those cultural moments to life for me.The Setting: Small shot at this, but wow were the shots beautiful of the coast and plateaus of the kingdom. I'm not sure about all the set pieces and CGI work given the blend to this film, but the cinematography at moments is breath taking to see the world to such a degree as what they got.The Action: By far my favorite part of the movie, the action of this film proves for the most part that we still have directors who understand dances of death. The Woman King has at least four action scenes I would call worth it, with a few micro moments to fill in the gap. In these moments, you get different feels for the moment, and the variety works very well to give these moments more of a reason than what many actors do. And in almost all the fights, the choreography is insanely good, with acting, moves, and stunt work blending together to really give the warrior's edge. I loved so much about this movie's battling, especially the epic fight about 75% of the way through the movie and feel that the bar is raised again for action choreography to follow.DISLIKES:A Little Scattered: The movie's plot is not perfect though, and like so many films requires more time to really capitalize on all the stories they tried to tell. The Woman King jumps around a bit at times, with several transitions diluted, or limited to these quick asides that in the grand scheme of things did very little to elevate the story. Not being mean, but so many stories does often lead to incomplete usage and there were potential stories that needed more fluff.John Boyega's Accent: It's a bit cheesy, it's a bit forced, but that doesn't mean I hate it. Boyega does his best with the accent given, and it's not as cheesy as some might have you believe. However, there were better ways to take the character if I'm being honest.The Villains Are A Bit Simplified/Extreme: What this means is that the Woman King's great character development arc did not extend to the antagonists of the film quite as well. Where Nanisca, Nawi, and Izogie hold so many layers to them, the other guys are just simply extreme bad guys that are lightning rods of hate to put your ire against. In addition the stereotypical moments really shine in these characters and I had liked more time to give them some depth given the power they held.Some Hard To Watch Moments: Pertinent to the story? Yes they are, but that does not make some of the moments easy to watch if you can't handle the unfortunate truth of those times. Sensitive fans need to prep themselves for some hard to watch moments that might make the bile in your gut rise. I won't say much, but you've been warned that some details might be hard to watch.The Final Fight is Poetic, But Not As Climactic: After the amazing fights and usage of the story elements, the final fight was a little bit of a letdown for me if I'm being honest. Sure, there are great moves at times, and there is a bit of edge to the madness, including some awesome moments of justice. But that fight before it was a thousand times better and I had liked a little more f that same coordination to make it feel like the film had not been rushed. Again, it has its own element and feel, but that last fight with so many things happening could have used a touch more time and planning for me to really call it the fantastic end it deserved.The VERDICT:
The Woman King had a lot of potential to be another political movie, but what I got was a great balance of many things that just needed more time to be perfected. While female led, there are plenty of other characters with side stories that work together quite well. It's a movie that pulls culture, visuals, costumes, and acting together to really create the tribe you expect to see. And the pacing of the tale, especially the utilization of action, might be some of the best I've seen in a very, very, very, long time. Sure, handling so much resulted in some stories not having the same kick I wanted to see, and there are shortcuts taken to compact it to 120 minutes like it wanted to do. However, the movie really did make a great theater experience for me and is worth the trip if you've got the time. My favorite movie of the three I watched, this reviewer gives The Woman King:Action/Drama/History: 9.0
Movie Overall: 8.0-8.5.",9/10
The Woman King (2022),"The Woman King is a scintillating portrayal of powerful women protectors driving change in one of world history's most pivotal and often heart-rending times: the era of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. Yet even through the beautifully-filmed and well-choreographed battle scenes, moments of love triumph and make this film worth watching.Set in the 19th century in the West African kingdom of Dahomey, The Woman King follows the all-female group of warriors, the Agojie, and their general, Nanisca (Viola Davis) as they fight, not just against the rival Oyo and Mahi tribes, but foreigners who wish to destroy their way of life and take their people. Along the way, Nanisca must grapple with her past... and Nawi (Thuso Mbedo), a young girl among the ranks of the Agojie who turns out to shape Nanisca's future.Director Gina Prince-Bythewood outdoes herself. Beyond being a film that does its bit to rectify historical exclusion of African narratives in Hollywood, The Woman King is a superb crowd-pleaser, with familiar thematic beats of moralism, love, and community and a fresh-enough take on the ""historical war film."" The sets transport viewers to pre-colonial Benin, and the cinematography, especially the use of light (inside the palace barracks) and color (the earthy tones of Dahomey's villages), further enhances the viewing experience. The background score by Lebo M. And Terence Blanchard draws on traditional West African music. It's simply goosebump-inducing to watch the Agojie charge into battle accompanied by soulful singing and the djembe and marimba. Good Lord - can Viola Davis do no wrong? The highly-proclaimed actress is perfect for the role of the ruthless, defensive, protective leader; the emotional depth Davis taps into is frankly impressive. She hits all the notes - trauma survivor, bereaved mother, sister in arms - impeccably. Davis' character's more conservative, regimented, typically ""top brass"" attributes are beautifully offset by Thuso Mbedo's portrayal of Nawi, the newest recruit who seems to challenge every rule so carefully enforced by Nanisca (and isn't afraid to confront Nanisca as an ""arrogant old woman""). Nawi and Nanisca's relationship flowers in a way that will make viewers say ""aww"" and though the two tussle every so frequently, the duo becomes the most lovable part of the film - a tough contest. A close second favorite is Izogie (Lashana Lynch), a more experienced member of the Agojie, who is equal parts hilarious, profound, and sweet. My favorite line of Izogie's is essentially, ""We all have a lot to cry about; it is better to laugh.""The Woman King promotes liberty, staying true to yourself, standing up for what is right, keeping your head held high (but your arrogance in check), obeying authority while also making wise decisions for yourself, and protecting those you love. Nanisca fights against King Ghezo's (John Boyega) vision to sell their prisoners of war to the Europeans for guns and other ""valuable"" goods, acting as a strong voice against racism and the commodification of humans.I give The Woman King 5 stars out of 5 and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. The Woman King releases in theaters on September 16, 2022.By Eshaan M., KIDS FIRST!",10/10
The Woman King (2022),"Can take nothing away from the acting performances here, Viola Davis is phenomenal, but I'd expect nothing less from her. The problem is, she's a bit underused. I went in expecting her to be the lead character, as shown in every Trailer and movie poster, however she's eventually relegated to a secondary role. Boyega does a pretty good job as well; one of his better performances.My major concerns are with the direction and cinematography. Camerawork looked very amateur, and the action sequences (outside of the splits from the trailer) are very underwhelming.This could've been an 8 or 9 with a better director. But unfortunately, I'd have to give it a 6/10.",6/10
The Woman King (2022),"9.5/10Amazing. Spectacular. Breath-taking. Endearing. Empowering. Inspiring. Purposeful. These are just some of the words that come to mind to describe this film.While I found ""The Woman King"" to take a long time to get to a point. There was reasoning behind that time. It's a slow, methodical build-up to an incredible story of strength, endurance, love, and loyalty. There's an excellent story to be told here, and there's no reason it should be rushed to tell it.Every time I saw the trailer for this film I thought two things. First, I'm fired up to see it. Second, it looks and feels very much like ""Black Panther"", which I wouldn't be surprised if there was inspiration drawn somewhere.The acting was incredible. I never think about awards when watching films, but I am hoping that Viola Davis wins ""Best Actress"" for her incredible performance. I also hope the film gets an award for ""Best Score"", as the music is its own living thing. It had me tapping in my seat, and feeling the moment as it happened on screen. In addition to Davis, I loved seeing the performances of Lashana Lynch and John Boyega, but also everyone chosen to play in this film embodied their roles to perfection.This film has definitely landed itself in my top three of the year, and perhaps even my number one! Everyone will have their own judgement on the film, but I hope you feel as much of an incredible story and adventure as I did.Overall, this film is 100% worth seeing in theatres. It's a fierceness that transcends a normal story about warriors. It's about a tribe that stands up and fights for what it believes, and finds inner healing along the way. I truly believe one award nomination will be given to this film.Thank you for reading my review. I hope it helps you make a decision on this film. Until next time.... Enjoy the show!",9/10
The Woman King (2022),"This movie was very different from what I expected and pleasantly so too. There is so much talent packed into this 2hour movie and it is very obvious all the people involved put real effort into this. Being Nigerian myself, I appreciated the real effort put into sounding like we do....the mannerisms, the accents, the clothing....it was all beautiful. I understand a bunch of funny people are hung up on the fact that this movie isn't ""historically accurate"". Please remember this isn't a documentary. It's a beautiful story told in spectacular fashion. Lovely cast, lovely cinematography. Please watch this at the cinema. It's worth it.",8/10
The Woman King (2022),"Viola is the only recognized name but she doesn't dominate the screen time, and that's a good thing. While Voila has her own storyline, many of the characters have their own storyline. The overall story is unique as it starts with the local tribal dynamics, and not countries. It also touches upon a subject that has been given very little publication time, and that's African's participation in the global slave trade and misogyny. Pretty solid acting, enunciating and timing with just about all the characters; both many and few adding to the overall depth of the movie. Personally, I don't think it's Braveheart and Black Panther as much as more of a person's painful past determining their path, and that goes with a lot of characters; not just Viola's. Coordinate that altogether and you have one fine movie.",9/10
The Woman King (2022),"Hollywood really needs to be released from the clutches of whoever decided on the so called African accent, never heard it before and it irritated me all movie long. I left the movie feeling conflicted, heading into it I thought it was going to be an exaggerated showing of black excellence or female power, it sorta was but this was more carefully portrayed. It was adrenaline pumping with a lot of action that was spread out to allow time for story and plot. It's slightly predictable though because the characters had threadbare personalities hence easy to read, once they were given an introduction you could deduce a lot of how their stories, hence the movie's as well, were going to unfold.It should have had a higher rating than pg13 though, because even though there was a lot of bloody fight scenes there wasn't much blood or gore; the fights were well choreographed so I'm not complaining much, the gory could have just made it better.As I said, the accent really annoyed me, other than that Viola Davis put in another strong performance, one of which we've become accustomed to by her so that was great casting. John boyega and Hero Fiennes Tiffin too, the latter with a role not usually associated with him. Lashana Lynch had the same problem as her previous roles were she slightly overdoes the tough guy role but the internet rushes to her defense claiming it's people who just don't like a strong black lead or something.If you think about it, it's not a story you haven't heard, only thing setting it apart is it's based in Africa during slavery and for that will probably get a cult like reception from some due to the message it carries, breaking chains and all. Not perfect but still pretty decent and worth a watch.",7/10
The Woman King (2022),"I saw The Woman King, starring Viola Davis-the DC super hero movies & tv shows, Ender's Game; Thuso Mbdeu-The Underground Railroad_tv, Scandal!_tv; Lashana Lynch-No Time To Die, Captain Marvel and John Boyega-Breaking, the Star Wars movies.This movie is inspired by true events and takes place in the 1800's in Africa. The Agojie were the King of Dahomey's elite, all female warriors/guards. John plays the King of Dahomey and Viola is the general in charge of the Agojie. The African tribes would raid other tribes for men, women and children to trade them for goods from the Europeans, who would then take their slaves away in ships. Viola tells John that she has had enough of the slave trading and wants to stop using the people and instead, trade in other goods. Lashana is a fellow Agojie and Thuso is one of the new recruits. The Agojie's training and tests are shown and after they graduate, you can see why they had the reputation of being so fierce in battle and could put a whooping on most men they encountered. There is a short scene just after the end credits start but nothing at the very end.It's rated PG-13 for violence, language and sexual content-including partial nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 15 minutes.I thought it was interesting and I would buy it on DVD.",7/10
The Woman King (2022),"Despite this movie having a basic plot description for what happens in this movie, trust me when I say the story for this movie is incredible. The story of this movie doesn't just tell this story of a female-led army but serves up two different purposes. The first purpose of the story of this movie is to help bring light to this piece of history. Before this movie came out or even the trailer how many people actually knew about this kingdom and army? Probably not many people who aren't from that area of the world or from the culture. This is why this story is so incredible because even though most of what you're seeing is false it still makes you want to look up and learn more about the Dahomey and the Agojie. The movie's story does a great job of hocking the audience along for this journey and showing just how badass these women were. This brings me to the second purpose of this movie's story which is to show and empower women to be warriors. Recently Hollywood has been getting better at showing stories of women as more than just a side character and The Woman King thankfully joins those ranks. This movie does not hold back when showing how tough these women are in comparison to the men and it's amazing. Due to this movie having a majority female cast it wasn't the hardest task to show how strong women are and especially show younger girls how strong they can be. Another part of this movie's story I really enjoyed was the African culture it included. I have to admit I'm not the right person to talk about African culture so I can't say how accurate it is but it was still interesting to see it included in this movie during the downtime between action scenes.But despite the incredible story of this movie the pacing for this movie is kind of weird. From the beginning of the movie to the end there is no clear passage of time so it's hard to tell how much time has passed. One second they're training the new recruits and the next it's the final test for the new recruits. This really isn't a big deal and doesn't take away from the movie as a whole but it kind of irks me. I would've loved to have seen them training more and seeing how they become to be these mighty warriors instead of some of the other scenes in this movie that easily could've been cut down or out of the movie and nothing would've changed. But it was hard to tell there were pacing issues when the acting for this movie was spectacular. Obviously one of the biggest names that's in this movie is Viola Davis, who plays Nanisca, and man does she steal the show. Viola Davis plays this no-nonsense leader who just cares about the people in her army while still showing some vulnerability. It's incredible to see her switch between being this serious leader and then showing vulnerability when she's around her closest friend. Another actress who stood out to me was Lashana Lynch, who plays Izogie. Lashana Lynch at first appears like she's going to be the comedic relief for this movie and in some ways she is but she also brings some humanity to this movie as well. With Izogie she shows how somebody can be this tough person on the outside but still be caring to those close to her. The last person I want to shout out is Sheila Atim, who plays Amenza. She doesn't get much screen time unfortunately but whenever she was on screen she was great. All of the actors in this movie did amazing jobs and helped bring the audience into this compound. I just want to quickly say if you ever get bored while watching this movie and Hero Fiennes Tiffin, who plays Santo Ferreira, is ever on the screen keep count of how many times he breaks his accent because trust me it happens quite often.With this movie being an action movie the pressure is on for the action scenes to be good and thankfully the action scenes in this movie kickass. All of the fighting in this movie is so well choreographed and knows how best to show off the strengths of each character in combat. The most impressive part of the action scenes is the knowledge that the actors all did their own stunts which helps bring the audience into the fights as well. What also helps with fight scenes is the framing and directing of the scenes to make sure they're easy to follow and Gina Prince-Bythewood, the director, did just that. The action scenes still had some edits put in to change the camera angle but you can tell that the directing for those scenes was to make them as clean and in focus as possible. But it wasn't just the fight scenes the directing was great during but the movie as a whole was directed so well. You can see how much passion Gina Prince-Bythewood had for this project and how she wanted to make sure the story was told and seen. Before I wrap this up I just want to rapid-fire shout out some other elements I loved from this movie due to how much it dived into African culture which are the costume designs, production design and the music, done by Terence Blanchard. In the end, The Woman King might not be fully truthful to the real Agojie army but this movie does an incredible job of making people want to learn about them. This is an important movie to check out, especially for women and probably will be an award-season favourite.",9/10
The Woman King (2022),"It's been a minute since my last trip to the movie theater, there just hasn't been anything that sparked my interest. A sentiment apparently not just my own. The manager at my theater of choice told me they've been opening late in the day since there hasn't been anything to draw folks in. I fully expected this to continue to be the case unit at least next month until I stumbled across an Instagram post by Viola Davis for The Woman King about a 19th century elite group of female African warriors. Real life Dora Milaje, not only starring but also produced by Davis and her husband? No doubt I HAD to see this film.The short and sweet of it? The Woman King is an exceptional movie.Period.Superb acting lead by the incomparable Viola Davis is just the start.Rising star Thuso Mbedu, Sheila Atim, and Lashana Lynch match Davis' power, ferocity, humanity, and emotion creating the heart/soul/core of the film. Their chemistry and interaction are mesmerizing and the solid foundation that the film is built upon.Dana Stevens and Maria Bello's script is rock solid and perfectly encapsulates all the strength, warmth, humor, pain, triumph, joy etc. That so many ""female"" based stories tend to lack and services both the story and actors beautifully. The richness this script has is a true rarity.Having Gina Prince-Bythewood (Love and Basketball and The Secret Lives of Bees) in the director's chair is an added bonus. The opening sequence had me glued to the screen and I couldn't look away the entire film. Fair warning, the action sequences are brutal and glorious, completely unwavering in their ferocity.The cinematography, musical score, sets, and direction all on point. The layering elevates the entire viewing experience.The Woman King is not just 2 hours 15 minutes of Viola Davis and company kicking ass (thought that wouldn't be a bad thing) it's a grown up, character driven triumph that transports viewers to pre-colonial Benin in a fresh take on historical war films. I can easily risk over hyping from my own enthusiasm, and risk underselling for fear of saying too much. So, I say, if you have the slightest interest in this one, just go. The Woman King needs to be seen/experienced on the big screen. It has all the feels, powerful messaging, and humanity/community we can all use right now.The Woman King is a 10.",10/10

I think many are naturally drawn to the name Viola, and I mean she is the lead character of this film, BUT... the star for me is Lashana Lynch! SHE was absolutely amazing.In terms of the story, I appreciated how the film made sure not to fully anchor the events of slavery (because we've been there and done that in films throughout the 70s, 80s, and 90s), and instead focused on ""oppressors,"" from both outside and within in, and the relationship to women.It's definitely a well packed and intentional PG-13 film.SN: I really love John Boyega! He had an interview on The Daily Show where he mentioned channeling his dad for this role, and putting on the pounds to give that ""healthy, paternal king-like vibe"", and there was a scene with Santo where he asked For his court to give Santo a seat, and I felt like I saw his dad in that entire moment LOLOTHER THOUGHTS:
Highlights: Lashana MF Lynch! Thematic followthrough, Viola Davis, the fight scenes, the overall Blackness, and the LGBTQ+ representation.Could've Been Better: Shante's storyline (just a little), and Nawi's character development/cohesion.",9/10
The Woman King (2022),"I was expecting Wakanda #2, but instead I got a bit of history without the flying cars and spaceships.The good:
-Finally the admission that black African tribes collaborated with EU in the slave trade.-Big old fight scenes reminescent of Braveheart
Viola Davis shared screen time equally with the other actorsThuso is a genuine ""IT"" girl, she should be given more acting work. She stole scenes from Viola.-the perfect part for Viola, and yes, she cried in the movie (as did the audience)
-The story was fairly easy to follow.The bad:
the changing hairstyles IMO were distracting. One day the hair (wigs) was Nappy Afro hair, the next it was braided, the next next it was tangled and kinky, the next next next it was garnished with jewels. Enough!!-It became a bit confusing if the Dahomey were actual slave traders because we never saw them imprison anyone and trade with the EUs.Oh well.Viola Davis had equal time with other actors, which was a good thing. And who was that hunky mulatto actor (yummy). And do you agree with me that John Boyega bears a close resemblance to Denzel Washington.",8/10
The Woman King (2022),"James Lipton once asked Chris Rock during an episode of Inside the Actors Studio if he would explain the use of the N-word in Black culture to his audience-prompting Rock to look back at him with the terrified wide-eyed response of, ""Now I got this job!?""A similar sentiment surely haunted everyone involved with The Women King, which attempts to tell a 19th century African story to a multicultural audience. The film has received plenty of scrutiny already, both from people skeptical that it could offer an accurate portrait of Africans' role in atrocities and those looking for a beacon of light to be shone on a misunderstood people and their history.""I knew what it would mean to us as Black people,"" said the film's star, Viola Davis, in an interview with Vanity Fair. ""Something that has never been done before. And what it would mean for Black women sitting in that movie theater. The responsibility is high.""The Women King rejects the notion that its responsibility is to teach African history in two hours. Instead, it tells a tale of pride, dignity, and agency against the backdrop of the fascinating Dahomey tribe. In short: With a stellar cast, filmmaker Gina Prince-Bythewood (who wrote for A Different World and directed Love & Basketball and The Old Guard) brings the legendary Agoji warrior women to life.Davis does an amazing job of playing Davis, without ever seeming to embody the persona of a stoic African warrior. Lucky for the film, this hardly matters. The sheer force she brings as an actor provides the essential emotional beats that a more authentic portrayal might have asked her to sacrifice.Meanwhile, the supporting cast of fellow warriors accomplish an astonishing amount of characterization through slight looks and limited dialogue that distinguish each of them within the unit. But the breakout star is the young Thuso Mbedu, who plays the headstrong recruit Nawi.At the beginning of the film, Nawi is a teenage girl being married off by her caregiver. Vigorously resistant to the choice being made for her, she's sent to live and train with the Agoji warriors, where she is to take no lovers and bear no children (it's not unlike joining the Night's Watch in Game of Thrones). She's stubborn, but her desire to be a warrior drives her through brutal trials-and helps her become a proud warrior.Set in 1823, The Woman King finds the Dahomey in a cyclical conflict with a neighboring tribe, enriching themselves with the sale of each other's prisoners to the international slave trade-and King Ghezo (John Boyega) of the Dahomey is being pressured to abandon the practice.The tribe's most passionate advocate for forsaking the slave trade is Nanisca (Davis), the general who leads the Agoji, which is Ghezo's fiercest fighting force. Her previous experience in slavery traumatized her to the point of clarity, convincing her that the Dahomey must break from the system they've chained themselves to before the tribes devastate each other.The brutality on display in the tribal war is measured. This is PG-13, after all, and that may be the one thing holding The Woman King back from being an epic, as opposed to merely a very good film (the filmmakers seem to have chosen accessibility over a fiercely accurate, R-rated depiction of war and slavery).This is in line with Roland Emmerich's ""historical"" Revolutionary War film The Patriot (2000). Both movies use loosely tied-together backstories within an authentic setting, while shoehorning an egregious love story into the plot (again, chalk it up to the accessibility factor).The Woman King sidesteps the accusations of its loudest prerelease critics, who demanded that all warts be shown in its depiction of the French and African tribes and the slave trade. The trailer elicited quite the backlash from people who claimed that the film would depict the ""noble"" Africans murdering their ""evil"" white oppressors.Not so much, it turns out. In The Woman King, the Africans are shown with relative historical accuracy concerning their own brutal war tactics, slavery for profit, and attitudes towards women. And as for the French slavers, they're not demonized beyond the understanding that the slave trade existed.In other words, The Women King is directed at a Black audience, but it's a movie for everybody. And if its existence causes people with racial animus to inadvertently study African history? Cool.Ray Gill Jr-Willamette Week.",8/10
The Woman King (2022),"The movies weaknesses are some of it's technical aspects. The direction is just ok and the editing at best does it no favors. The fight scenes in particular were essentially uninspired and typical, and over edited. For the first third or so, I couldn't always make out a word at time like the sound mix was bad, though could always be the theater sound system itself. I also felt the runtime a bit, which for a guy who loves The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Rober Ford is saying something. Maybe lose 15 min, mostly 1 unnecessary sub plot. The aforementioned editing didn't help in this area either.It looked like much of the outdoor photography at least was shot Africa, big plus. The actors are all in. Boyega nails his part without overdoing it as a king. The main warrior women are interesting and very distinguishable. All did terrific jobs and sell being great warriors, especially the ones playing veterans. They all seem invested and help make the movie worth it.Big positive: if you're looking for a movie going for woke points, this isn't the movie for you, meaning go see it. You'll learn something. The main conflict is dealing directly with the internal problem of Africans slave trading other Africans. It's the main point. Even the 'good guy' tribe is dealing with having sold its own, and are the good guys because they desire to turn from that path, not because they are unrealistic flawless idealists.The white slavers do play a small part, and are Portuguese slavers from Brazil; another welcome touch.The realistic way they dealt with the issues is the film's saving grace and it deserves to be seen to show Hollywood that black actors deserve more than to be randomly chucked in as Achilles or Nordic chiefs for social points. Plus, negatives aside it is pretty good and worth seeing. Give this film your money, it deserves it.",7/10
The Woman King (2022),"I Believe that this comment section shows the great divide between the audience and the critics. I thought this movie was outstanding. I was a bit skeptical walking into this movie thinking that it was just going to be another ""garbage politically correct period piece"" but the morality of this movie was complex, the characters and the acting was outstanding, the action was riveting. And keep in mind I was at an NCG theater in Marietta GA with almost an exclusively black audience and everyone loved it and even clapped at several times throughout the film. This movie deserves so much better than the reviews it's getting and I hope it gets the recognition it deserves.",8/10
The Woman King (2022),Overall if you haven't seen this movie and are criticizing it for slavery depiction or feminism ect.. you need to watch it. It did a brilliant job of NOT bringing in political modernism and telling the story of this tribe which has women and men warriors unlike other tribes that just focused on men and its story from the year 1823 (when they were at war with other tribes & such) The balance was really great.Slavery: they talk about it. They condemn it. The tribe does it and talks about how they have done it. Viola Davis character talks about how they need to stop doing it. The movie does NOT glorify or shy away from the brutality that it was.History: there is a beautiful article explaining the history inine with the movie with historians. Look up: time the woman King true story.Anyway it was a good movie that made you care about all the characters and forget about the time.,9/10
The Woman King (2022),"Genuinely excellent. Films that are written, directed, and especially acted well enough to earn tears and cheers should be forgiven of historical inaccuracies and small narrative missteps like the romantic subplot. This is a modern story for a modern audience, particularly an American audience, and that should also be taken into account when we consider historical accuracy. As an emotional power-ballad about the strength of black women and the need to fight for honor, respect, and virtue, this film rocks. The entire cast is superb, the emotional climaxes are earned, and the film's heart is in the right place.",9/10
The Woman King (2022),"It is an interesting thing to rewrite history so that the power is given back to the people who were introduced to the cycle of slaving and being enslaved by countries that would oppress them and destroy their development for centuries to come. The movie encourages some of those conversations, and while it's a little clean, it doesn't shy away from what it is. Anyone who is frustrated by the adaption, is hopefully also frustrated at all of Tarantino's adaptions which do exactly the same thing.A great action movie, featuring a mostly black-female cast, and helmed by a black woman, which is almost never seen in this capacity. Well worth the watch.",9/10
The Woman King (2022),"If The Woman King's only issue we're the fact that it presents itself as a ""true story"" yet is about as historically accurate as Space Jam, that would be one thing. (I'll get to this later.)Unfortunately, aside from the committed performances from most of the cast (especially Viola Davis), this is also one of the clunkiest narratives I've seen put to screen in some time.The romantic subplot is rushed and entirely without substance or feeling. The central young woman Nawi supposedly has a traumatic past that we are barely told about, and she has no character growth at all. She wants to be a soldier, so she does. She's arrogant and disobedient at the beginning of the film and continues to be like this to the end.Davis's character Nanisca has an arc-at least on paper. She is emotionally closed off due to trauma and then decides not to be. But this change happens within two minutes of screen time and occurs off screen. It's kind of hilarious how unearned it is.The story has no actual fleshed-out antagonist. There are a couple of villainous persons but their goals are vague at best and cartoonish at worst.All this could occasionally fall to the wayside if the action sequences were good. But this film has some of the worst action I've seen put to film this year.Nearly all of the fight scenes are exceptionally clumsy in how they're shot and edited. Far more often than not, the shots consist of our heroes swinging at someone off screen or so visibly for away from them that it's obvious to anyone with functioning depth perception that no actual strike took place.Equally as often is the occasional shot in which the enemy soldiers literally-and hilariously-just patiently stand there waiting for the good gals to come take them down.Okay, now for the elephant in the theater: the insulting historical ""basis"" for the film.For a movie that wants to bemoan the evils of colonialism, the filmmakers really are colonializing the culture of nineteenth century west Africa.How? By paving over the Dahomey's centuries-old historical acts of human sacrifice and voluntary brutal enslavement of both their own and foreign people. The writers slap their 21st century feminism on top of a historically brutal culture and call it a day.In reality, the Dahomey would have scoffed at the idea of ending the slave trade, as they only stopped trading slaves in the mid-19th century because the British forced them to stop. But this film depicts most of them as freedom-fighting abolishionists and acts as though the slave trade didn't exist until Europeans invented it. This is nonsense.Imagine if there were a film made today about the American civil war in which the confederates were portrayed as freedom-fighting abolishionists who had slavery forced upon them by the north.This would be rightly condemned, so why aren't people enraged at the convenient erasure of uncomfortable history that is propagated by this film?It's a largely incompetent piece of filmmaking, and it's an insulting, culturally offensive piece of writing.It's shameful.",2/10
The Woman King (2022),"When I went into this movie, I already knew very well the history surrounding the Agojie and the actions done by the African kingdom of Dahomey. But because I've almost always appreciated and liked the roles that Viola Davis chooses, I gave it a try.After Viola Davis declarations about what it would mean if people didn't went to see the movie, a big part of me wanted nothing more than to not even see the movie. But I took her statements, as her making a huge mistake, that might hurt an actual good movie.And as it turned out, I wouldn't have lost anything if I hadn't watched this movie.From Viola Davis, to Lashana Lynch Izogie and others. The performances were for the most part solid, and the natural beauty of the African continent all helped to make the movie tolerable.However try as they might, and they did try, history didn't happened that way. Not exactly. The Woman King gives you the Hollywood edited version of history, but it doesn't give you the actual history. The ugly side of the tribe that Nanisca (Davis) is portraying.It's understandable why they did what they did, seeing the times they were living, and the movie should've owned that, instead of trying to embellish the truth. Anyone with an ounce of common sense would've understood, or at least tried to understand what was happening historically in that period of African history.But apparently they are too ashamed to own to their own history. Maybe because the actresses and actors, didn't even bother to study the history of what they were going to be portraying.The movie is not good, not really. It's watchable, not just because of the performances but also because of the beauty of the African continent, and also in part the culture as well. However they could've cut twenty minutes to the movie and you'd have lost nothing.It has too many moments that are slow paced, and then it just puts in the fifth gear and doesn't slow down. To the viewer that doesn't know anything about what they're watching, they might be deceived into thinking they saw a a movie about female empowerment, and how to fight against oppression to preserve one's freedom. Because that's what the movie tries to sell.And it's really because of the embellishment of a hard reality, that was the reality of those times, that I couldn't really appreciate this movie. It would be like applauding inaccuracy for the sake of creating a nice story, instead of owning the truth and show how many times sacrifices and hard choices need to be made.I completely understand how some people might be more than willing to close their eyes to those things, but the dual standard isn't lost considering other historical movies were also a target of great scrutiny. And if memory fails you, then remember the criticism done about Kingdom of Heaven for not accurately portraying the Islamic side of history.So if all other historical movies have been subjected to critic of their historical accuracy, then The Woman King doesn't get a free pass. At least not from me.And then there's the story of the movie itself. Completely predicable from beginning to end, some of the dialogues were cringe as cringe can be, and some actresses like Viola Davis tried to sell their roles so hard that it came out as far over the top.Twelve Years a Slave was a great movie, however The Woman King is not. It's watchable in a way that you can see it and pass the time, but without ever getting pulled into the story.This movie will add nothing to the career of the actresses and actors in it. And it will add little to viewer, that spends the 135 minutes watching it.And so there's no doubts, this movie lost me because a) the story wasn't good enough b) the story is too predictable c) some performances are just too over the top and d) the historical inaccuracy is unforgivable.",4/10
The Woman King (2022),"I enjoy history and like to see accurate representations in films. I will say straight away that I intensely dislike films that have an agenda and are incredibly historically inaccurate as a result, e.g., Braveheart, 300, The Patriot. However, I can easily accept and enjoy films a bit historically inaccurate as films primarily exist to entertain, i.e., most Hollwood historical films.Unfortunately, TWK falls into the former category. If they had stuck to the real story, then it could have been an interesting film about a little-known African Kingdom, particularly with the lovely images of Africa. Instead, they decided to make it as a black female empowerment, anti-European propaganda piece. Sure, slavery is central to the film but with a twist, in that slavery was in place to make money from Europeans, for which Dahomey reluctantly supplied slaves to feed a European need. The truth is that Africans had been supplying slaves for thousands of years to Arabs, Egyptians, Romans, etc, and keeping hundreds of thousands for themselves. Europeans had a relatively 'short' involvement with the African slave trade, and Europe's largest contribution (primarily British) was to end the African slave trade, against the wishes of African kings and slave traders. The female warriors are shown as some sort of Spartan elite, which they were not, as they primarily attacked and seized women and children as slaves and were easily defeated by the French in hand-to-hand combat. In fact, the French lost 6 soldiers killed whilst the Dahomey warriors, including the female 'elite', lost many hundreds killed. The female warriors and their general were misrepresented in the same way that the Waffen SS would be misrepresented if portrayed as peace-loving pacifists!A good film could have been made of court intrigue or the impact of Dahomey slavers on raided villages, but no, propaganda and politics rules the roost in Hollywood.",2/10
The Strays (2023),"This movie starts off with 35 minutes of pointlessness. A well off housewife stressed out and concerned. That's act 1. I don't want to write spoilers here so I'll just tell you it doesn't get better, it gets worse and worse and worse.The plot holes are massive. I mean you would have to suspend all reality of society to believe some of the things that occur to set up the ""story"" or ""plot"" or whatever this thing is.The ""plot"" is allegorical and so basic. Why do films like this even get made? How do scripts like this get financed? Black mail? I don't get it. Even the acting isn't great.There are other parts where you will just shake your head and ask: Why. That's the main question. This is utter nonsense.

The Strays (2023),"Strays is an interesting and thought provoking debut by writer/director Nathaniel Martello-White. A woman flees an abusive life to create her ideal world with another man, only her past will not stay buried.That's the basic outline, but Strays deals with a lot more. Told initially from Cheryl/Neve's viewpoint, we meet a woman who wanted more from her life. Clearly scared by her partner, she just leaves her life, walking out one day. We then move to see the new life she's created, a perfect suburban lifestyle. She's a successful deputy head teacher at an exclusive private school and is fundraising for a charity to help underprivileged children in Africa.But Neve is more complicated than the stepford wife she is trying to portray. She's literally run from her past, and everything about it. She's living a 'white' lifestyle with her cultural heritage hidden from herself. She won't let her children identify as black, she's working at the most privileged of environments, and acting as a saviour for black children she'll never meet, guilting her neighbours into donating money to the charity that is used to improve her social standing, far more than it is to benefit the recipients of the charity.She's not entirely comfortable with her place though, self consciously scratching herself under the straight haired wigs she wears to hide her natural hair. Her makeup also whitens her skin so she 'fits' more comfortably as a blackish woman in white society.Then things start to fall apart, because Neve didn't just run away from her life as Cheryl when she left her partner, she also left her children, Marvin and Abigail, who have now returned after years of separation. Both have been traumatised by their lives since their mother abandoned them, in and out of care and foster homes, unwanted and unloved. Neve is terrified that their return will destroy the life she has carefully crafted. They're a reminder of her old life, her failed life, and it is absolutely important to note that these children are darker than her new children, it's impossible for them to 'pass' as Neve has tried to ensure her new children do.Forced to confront her past, Neve opts to pay off her children to leave her life, burying her dirty secret with £20,000 and a vague promise to work on their relationship. Neve even tries to justify abandoning her children to her new family by saying she's done nothing worse than many men (and there is a point here, as a woman, walking out on your children is considered far worse than a man doing the same). It's another issue for black families who are 24% single mothers in the UK, vs 10% for single white mothers.Neve, again selfishly buys off her guilt and expects it to just go away, an act of reparation for her previous transgressions. But her children wanted more, despite Marvin's anger and aggression, he wanted to be loved, to create a family for his sister and himself. So when Abigail's birthday comes around, her fragile psyche is broken and Marvin returns with her for a final confrontation with Neve.True to her nature, in a jarring final scene, with the violent chaos of her life and choices closing in on her and her family, Neve opts once again to run away, leaving her children, new and old to deal with the consequences of her actions. The sudden end is jarring and may be disappointing to some viewers, but it's a perfect end as Neve leaves to most likely, repeat this one more time.Gender politics, cultural politics, black shame, white guilt, colonial legacy, white privilege, broken families, there is so much to unpack in Strays that the viewer can look at this as a dark tragic drama, or pull on any one thread that Nathaniel Martello-White has left dangling. The performances are all excellent and the slow building tension is expertly crafted. It's not a film I'll likely watch again, but hours later, I'm still pulling on those threads.",6/10
The Strays (2023),"Seriously - HOW did this get made?!Netflix obviously have a habit of churning out pulpy thrillers, and I've watched (or at least tried to watch) almost all of them, and I can safely say, of all of them, hands down - this has the WORST dialogue and performances that border on the hysterical. It's hard to blame the actors for that, they're making the best of a VERY bad screenplay - and presumably, incompetent performative direction.Visually it's decent. That was obviously the priority for the filmmaker. The only priority. It's the only thing that makes sense.I really can't fathom how this got made. Who's this guy sleeping with at Netflix to get this off the ground ahead of so many blacklist scripts? They must be pretty high up or have a lot to hide because WOW. Rubbish.Only given 2 rather than 1 because I did honestly laugh more than once in the opening ten minutes at the hackneyed dialogue.",2/10
The Strays (2023),"I think the confusion about this flick is that it's actually supposed to be the way it is.I experienced a weird feeling watching it.The main character is so constantly flustered by by her own perceptions of what should be versus what isn't versus internal guilt and manifested external rage...that it's actually remarkably crafty how indiscreet the acting is. If this makes sense.That being said, I don't think it quiets get there and there are some farcical extended moments of doldrum that keep it from being a really good film.I watched it to the end to see what happens and there is closure, so in my books the story was told. It is sort of creepy, more a thriller than anything else.",6/10
The Strays (2023),"This was the most pointless excuse of a movie I have ever seen. I want my time back. It started off very promising and just went all the way down under the hill from there. Acting was terrible maybe because the script was sooooo poor. So sad. I'm so angry I can't give it less than a star. The only thing worse than sitting through it to see if it would by some chance redeem itself, was the ending. Such a waste of my time, energy and electricity. Wish I had read the reviews before watching this mess. My goodness the rubbish that passes for entertainment these days is astounding. Find something else to watch!",1/10
The Strays (2023),"I cannot believe I stuck with this through the end credits.It is so awful.It could have been a touching and heartfelt story about a woman who left her children and never looked back. And now must somehow find a way to welcome them into her new family.But, no, instead we are server with a horror show.It took me a long time before I understood why she felt so threatened by these 2 strangers coming around.Once the 2 strangers are identified, we enter an entirely implausible situation.She freaks out, seeming almost demented about the man and young woman who begin to invade her space. But then her 2 children become friends with the strangers and the mother is nowhere to be seen. And the father has no objections. Not likely. Especially having the girl over.Also the boy and the man become friends. The man seems to be training the boy to be tougher . Together they attack a student from the boy's high school, who has been bullying him. What they do to him is horrific, probably a murder. But there is nothing mentioned about the attack afterwards. The bully did not report them to the cops? He was killed? Who knows. We will never know.The very last minute, literally, is very satisfying.I think this film is somewhat racist. The full Black ones are animals, and the mixed race ones are civilized.",3/10
The Strays (2023),"I clicked on The Strays knowing nothing about it, and i'm glad I did as I think the preconception of it being terribly acted/scripted would have dampened my viewing experience. Yes, there are flaws here but I don't think these are down to the actors abilities, so much as a mismatch of direction, staging and direction. It felt like it didn't know what it wanted to be. Was it a horror? Was it a gritty british itv drama? Was it low budget? High concept? It seemed to travel through all those identities and didn't seem to settle until the crescendo at the end of it being a horror thriller....kind of.Having now read that the writer wanted to portray Neve as a multi layered character, neither good nor bad, I can make sense of what they were trying to achieve. The actors did the best with what they presented, but unfortunately there was a bizarre mix of surreal and realism that just became confusing. I couldn't help but think 'is this trying to be Get Out lite but got lost on the way?'. Also characters needed fleshing out a little. Details were scant apart from a mention of a stay in a psychiatric unit, children being 'got rid of', and a maybe abusive relationship. There was no explanation as to how Neve had achieved her position, or what her intentions were at key moments.Saying all this, I'm glad I watched The Strays. It kept me gripped, I was interested in the subject matter, it just failed in a consistent tone or a fully rounded narrative sadly.",7/10

The Strays (2023),"What tempts you into believing that The Strays is a film that discusses classist, racist connotations eventually settles into a sore home-invasion thriller with an unsettling twist. The 'Jordan Peele' stylistic choices, be it in the script or the visuals, are hard to dismiss. The primary issue, however, is that when Neve's pretty little world starts to fall apart, I could already anticipate what was going on in the background. Writer-director Nathaniel Martello-White then spends a whole chapter detailing what happened a few days earlier to explain the proceedings from another perspective. Rebecca Hall's Resurrection was a masterclass in portraying a psychologically-affected protagonist when someone from her past shows up, but Ashley Madekwe's performance comes with a sense of deliberation. She comes across as more of an escapist and not someone who accepts her past demons, making the only strongly written character in the film the least accessible.",4/10

The Strays (2023),The film was not realistic and relied on too many stereotypes. The cast was competent but didn't have an opportunity to display their talent. The motive for two of her children being angry and wanting to harm and kill those who did nothing to them is weak. The film's ending as it begins is weak. The Stepford family's cinematography was good.The film premise of being so engulfed in self-hatred over your skin complexion for material wealth is fascinating and could've been a great psychological thriller. The writer and director making the mother's hair an issue was funny and extreme. The number of scenes at the school was unnecessary and made the storytelling drag.,4/10

The children she abandoned grow up, do the tiniest bit of stalking, make friends with their half siblings then eventually kill her new husband in a home invasion type scenario that is weak and watered down (literally). Then she leaves and abandons all four children. This movie looks like a low budget Lifetime movie and has a plot that actually could have been intriguing but flatlines halfway through. I remember when the trailer dropped on YouTube and everyone in the comments thought it was just going to be so amazing. I assure you the trailer is as good as it gets.",2/10
The Strays (2023),"No pun intended and obviously not Jack. I understand that some people may have issues with the movie. And I salute the performances - because they are sublime and subtle - even when they look ridiculous and may make you angry and/or annoyed. It is meant to be the way. This is not meant to be something you should like - being able to put those things out there ... well it is important ... and if you watch this until the end you may even understand why.Again no pun intended - especially because the ending is really .... well it is a tough one to swallow. It may even make you search the internet to find an explanation. You won't find one here, because that would mean I would have to talk about the movie, the characters and the story overall. I want you to find out on your own. There is a reason the beginning is there ... and it ... well mirrors the end in a good sense (yes you can say that is another pun).A movie that dares - and a filmmaker that thinks a lot of the viewers ... keeping them on their toes ... hopefully you'll appreciate it ...",8/10
The Strays (2023),"So apparently it seems most white people have never heard of Passing or read any accounts of the damage it inflicted upon many black families in the past...The movie had a great premise but not enough time to execute it properly. There were a lot of hidden messages in the film. The leather belt hanging on the back of the door in Cheryl's apartment which most black people know all too well... Neve beating her son with her slipper links back to the belt.Neve constantly scratching at her head, the roots growing on the walls, and the roots growing from her head like the roots of a tree. Her black roots she tries to ignore and bury. Mary's baby hair swoops and the afro pick crazy big sis gives her.The color red throughout was likely the director or writer paying homage to Jordan Peele.The ending could've been better but I don't see what people found so confusing about it. Cheryl/Neve was obviously mentally ill with Dissociative Personality Disorder and other issues. Her two older kids likely inherited mental illness from their mom and abusive father. But they were also abandoned by their aunt and likely raised in abusive foster system which would also contribute towards their anger and mental illnesses.They were likely going to leave their mother alive, but take everything from her. They thought that would cause her the most pain, but they didn't realize their mom isn't capable of actually caring or having feelings for anyone but herself.",8/10
The Strays (2023),"A lot of people hating on this movie maybe just didn't get it or have been indoctrinated by cookie cutter Hollywood productions or remakes that fall flat. This movie makes you uncomfortable in a good way. And it didn't even have to be made about a black family though that adds another complex layer to this film.A mother leaving her family as opposed to fathers who seem to get a pass is the real crux of this movie.. Revenge from children coming back from the past and the dilemma of guilt and not wanting to call the authorities on your own estranged children because of that guilt. Then in the end, taking the easy way out. Again. Give it a chance. It's quite an interesting film.",8/10
The Strays (2023),"The beginning was slow but good. The movie tried to make the MC looked like she had gone crazy. I knew it was about kids that either she killed or abandoned. Apparently, she abandoned the kids bcs the father was bad and now the kids coming back to her perfect life with definitely bad intention. It's like those ppl who blamed everything that happened to them were their mother's fault. Also the mother left bcs allegedly the man before was dangerous and thought she left the kids (whom she didnt want) with their aunt. I knoww the kids got abandonment issues, and the mother did bad things, didnt really make them have the right to kill the new family. The son made the new son either killed or injured a bully. The daughter got so jealous to the new daughter and she seemed to be insane. In a way, it was good for her to leave them bcs they are bad people. They are murderer. No sympathy at all to those kids. Well she left her new kids too but what could you do. Weird movie. I guess they tried to make it looked like 'jordan pelle's' movie or something. But it's failed. Failed miserably. Sorry not sorry.",2/10
The Strays (2023),"Horrible movie, no acting, no plot, no dialogue, nothing.....As usual for Netflix, the trailer was a bit catchy I was really excited to watch it but the movie's plot ended the first 10 mins. Do not expect it to be a typical revenge movie because the writers took a nap at this part and was bored to add it to the movie that to his/her surprise it was the most important part of the movie. The ending was the silliest thing ever. Please do not try to waste your time on that nonsense. Rarely ever that I write a movie review but I could not hold myself. All the actors do not have an inch of talent. The protagonist is expression less one.",1/10
The Strays (2023),"I didn't wanna watch this film first because of the bad reviews! I'm glad I'm usually never listen to reviews and always make my own opinions when it comes to movies bc let's face it, it's all a matter of taste.Most people seem disappointed in it, too slow, no plot, bad acting, horrible ending bla bla. Ok but in my opinion this was a very well done movie that made me feel awkward almost during the whole film. Meaning it made me feel something that most movies these days don't! It was uncomfortable to watch mainly because of the topic of the mother being ashamed of her background, hiding her roots & her past. She obviously hated her old life and was mentally ill. This movie covers so many psychological aspects! It's an important story to tell and it's not meant to make you feel good or to have a happy ending. I'm tired of people reviewing movies bad bc they didn't like the end! Ever watched a Lynch movie seriously!I can only suggest you to watch it, to have an open mind and to get your own opinion.Ps the end was brilliant, it closed the circle perfectly fine!",9/10
The Strays (2023),"I'll start off by saying that reading through the reviews *before* watching the movie will almost definitely influence your opinion of the movie even while watching it. The movie is by no means a perfect one. But it has good moments, keeps you interested, has a surprise ending (some might not like that). The plot holes are glaring and I can see why people can be mad at that. But they are not something many people who watch with a suspension of belief, will be bothered by. The pacing is quite good, quality is good and acting is good. Storyline itself has its ups and downs like the movie itself.",6/10
The Strays (2023),"From the very beginning of the movie, I saw where this was going. SPOILER ALERT *** a black mother on welfare trying to raise two kids she admits she didn't want. Cheryl is selfish and does what SOME black men have done for years. She abandons her two children. ""She left to get milk"" as some would put it, and the abandoned kids get passed around, unwanted and grow up bitter. I get it.""Neve"" finds opportunity with her ""light skin"" to gain status, wealth and privilege. Like many (don't tell me I don't know what I'm talking about because I KNOW) ""Passé Blanc"" blacks, she's living the life she's wanted, and doesn't want her biracial children to associate with Black culture although the kids are raised knowing they're black. The ""one drop rule""...
I get it.Towards the end without going into too much detail because it's disturbing AF, there is no preference for dark skin black children, or light skin black/ biracial children, it's just a selfish, heartless human being who is only looking out for themselves. I get it.The story has some plot holes here and there. I think the acting is great! Point made, and if you think this is a racist movie, you're correct. It is. It shows how a struggling black mother chose herself over the hardships of being black in poverty. Whiteness was a way out.",9/10
The Strays (2023),"It's a horror story where the monsters are two abandoned black children who terrorize, torture, and murder their mum's new half-white family.The only one who survives relatively intact is the mum Neve, who runs away. (Again.) The rest end up horribly traumatized, in prison, or dead.The director made it very clear that the black characters are awful and dangerous. Carl, the abandoned son, is a brutal sadist and a murderer. Dione, his sister, is selfish and infantile. Neve, the mum, hates being black, and is an irresponsible coward with major issues.Nothing is resolved. There is no character development. No growth. This film does not deal with any of the problems it presents. It just turns into a standard horror film instead.The only two white characters of any significance (the dad, Ian, and the white bully) end up being tortured to death.The biracial boy Sebastian is bullied into being a thug and probably a murderer by his half brother.The white bully (no idea what his name is) didn't actually do anything other than taunt Sebastian. Rather than taunt him back, Sebastian is terrorized and bullied by his half-brother Carl into violence.The scene where the white bully is attacked is shown from the bully's point of view. The director presents him as the innocent victim being stalked by monsters in the night. He is powerless, terrified, at the point of death by suffocation, completely unable to fight back, and that is when Sebastian attacks him. We have no idea whether or not the poor guy even survived. I wouldn't be surprised if the two half-brothers buried the body.The biracial girl Mary is the only one who still seems like a nice, normal person at the end, tho after finding her father's corpse in the basement, I would expect her to be traumatized for life.This wasn't a commentary on racism. To me, it felt like like racism.",4/10
Tár (2022),"It is not surprising that this film is tanking at the box office since it is much too long and slow paced for the average movie goer's attention span. Indeed parts of it, like the agonizingly protracted opening scene where a New Yorker magazine music critic interviews the title character about her classical music esthetics, seem designed by writer/director Tod Field as a boredom experiment wherein if you can survive it without running and screaming into the night out of sheer and utter ennui then you are worthy to see the rest of his ""masterpiece"".Thing is, though, that a lot of this film does approach, if not encroach upon, masterpiece territory. Certain scenes, like Lydia Tar's bleak Staten Island homecoming where she summons the spirit of her mentor Leonard Bernstein in an effort to recapture the humanistic values she has lost, are genuinely heartbreaking. And the sequences that deal with Lydia's manipulation of her acolytes are difficult to watch as we see how artistic power feels even more corruptible, somehow, than the political kind, perhaps because it is a profanation of a purer space.And I think we can all agree that Cate Blanchett is one helluva fine actor! As are Nina Hoss, Noemie Merlant and Sophie Kauer who play various of her entourage/victims.Bottom line: For all its faults I have a sneaking suspicion that in twenty years they'll be watching this and not ""The Fabelmans"". Give it a B plus.",8/10
Tár (2022),"I believe that people in positions of authority should be held accountable for their actions. I believe that terrible people can make miraculous art. I believe that people studying an art form have an obligation to understand and engage with the full history of that art form, even when it's made by people who identify very differently from them. I believe that 99% of people accused of misdeeds are guilty to some extent of those misdeeds. I believe that there are many people who seek to avoid engaging with complex ideas and perspectives that challenge them and make them uncomfortable. I believe that everyone is guilty at times of making sweeping generalizations about others. I believe that there are positive things we can learn from people who might be terrible in other ways. I believe that both people participating voluntarily in a transactional relationship bear responsibility for the outcomes of that relationship. I believe that people are incredibly complex and can be many things at once. I believe we live in a social media world that more and more doesn't want to acknowledge that and wants to be able to smack an easy meme and label on everything.What does ""Tar"" -- the movie, not the character -- believe? Maybe all of the above. Maybe none of the above. The beauty of ""Tar"" is that it raises a host of complex questions but doesn't force any answers on the viewer. This is a movie made for adults that lets us think for ourselves. A lot of people are interpreting it as an examination of cancel culture. I can see why, though that isn't how I primarily interpreted it. I don't think it's as much about the rights and wrongs of cancel culture as much as it's about our complicated relationships with artists and the art they create. The movie isn't exclusively about Americans, but the writer and director Todd Field is, so I think it's also about how the only thing Americans enjoy more than turning someone into an unrealistic hero is to rip them apart when they fail to live up to our expectations.This is a movie I cannot stop thinking about. I didn't love it, though I liked it a lot. There's something slightly cold about it, so while I enjoyed the intellectual rigors of it, I didn't feel very emotionally involved. I started to feel its length as it moved into its final scenes. But I can't think of a movie I've seen recently that makes me want to talk to someone about it as much as this one, and that's got to be worth something.Nothing needs to be said about Cate Blanchett other than that she is magnificent.Grade: A.",9/10
Tár (2022),"Greetings again from the darkness. I seriously doubt that I'll ever skip a Cate Blanchett movie. She's won two Oscars and has been nominated six times. She's consistently the best part of her movies, and often the best in a full year of movies. Here she stars in the first film in 16 years from the remarkable writer-director Todd Field. His two previous films, LITTLE CHILDREN (2006) and IN THE BEDROOM (2001) combined for eight Oscar nominations, and more importantly, established Mr. Field as a rare and unique filmmaker of great depth. Having Field reappear and cast Blanchett generated a heap of excitement from this film nerd.Ms. Blanchett stars as Lydia Tar, a piano virtuoso, the conductor of the famed Berlin Orchestra, and a true musical genius. She's a rare EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony) from the classical field. Her music (and her life) is a quest to uncover/discover what the composer meant with each piece. Lydia is sometimes rough on her wife Sharon (Nina Hoss), but frequently dotes on their young daughter ... while otherwise living a relative selfish and self-centered life. We also see this true persona in how she treats her young assistant Francesca (Noemie Merlant), who quietly aspires to become a conductor, while efficiently keeping Lydia on track each day.The film begins with ""New Yorker"" writer Adam Gopnik interviewing Lydia as a stage presentation in front of a live audience. It's his introduction of the Maestra where we learn her background and the proficiency that has garnered her such respect (as well as jealousy and animosity). Throughout the film, many real musicians (past and present) are referenced, and that detailed research is alone enough to earn respect for what Mr. Field has accomplished here. The stress and laser-focus on Lydia as she prepares for the final symphony in her Mahler portfolio (his 5th). We witness the meticulous detail that goes into managing the music and musicians, and this leads to handling the dismissal of veteran who is slipping, and the addition of a brilliant young cellist named Olga (Sophie Kauer). We are never quite sure if Lydia's attraction to Olga is limited to her skills with the bow.Of course, any perfectionist at the top of their industry is subject to backlash and criticism. Is Lydia abusive? Is she exploitive? It seems the answers may be affirmative, and likely what drives her art. It's quite discomforting to watch as she covers her tracks after the suicide of a former pupil, but I'll admit to a certain feeling of satisfaction as she verbally spars with another student over gender semantics ... actions that of course come back to bite her.Ms. Blanchett is fascinating and mesmerizing to watch. She is at the top of her game playing a perfectionist who is at the top of her game. However, it's clear this film isn't likely to strike the right notes with mainstream audiences. It's an arthouse film about art, and thus is filled with dialogue and much less actual music than you might expect for a film about a world class Orchestra conductor.Opens in theaters on October 21, 2022.",8/10
Tár (2022),"Everybody writing about this mock biopic focuses on Cate Blanchett's knock-it-out-of-the-park performance, but when compared to Field's ""Little Children"" (2006), ""Tár"" lacks the storytelling and editing skills which make the earlier film a masterpiece of human relations, whereas the latter is an interesting character study that somehow collapses under its own weight.There's a strong establishing scene showing Tár demolishing an aspiring musician's conceited views on Bach, yet one has to wait for a long time for a follow-up showing the main character's boundary issues. The central topic emerges rather quickly (abuse of power), but there are diversions which support character development, yet drag on the narrative, which is probably why many reviews here find the film frustrating.Being an ex-Berliner, I like the fact that the city is being used as a real location as opposed to the usual tourist / Cold War hot spots, and the Philharmonics rehearsal scenes are very well done, but they don't really push the story forward and could have easily been wound down a bit.Nina Hoss as Tár's partner is a brilliant counterpoint, because she keeps a good deal of her thoughts to herself until she doesn't, so more focus on their relationship would have helped the story. Hoss would deserve a supporting actress Academy Award nod if only she had more screen time.The initial scene of conflict eventually loops back into focus, and Field could have used this to explore societal misjudgment as he did in ""Little Children"" - but he doesn't, which makes ""Tár"" rather distant and cold. Field expects viewers to interpret a lot on their own, which is bold and demanding, but with this approach it is crucial to keep focus on an underlying message, otherwise it gets lost.In conclusion, ""Tár"" has all the ingredients for a masterpiece - interesting characters, great performances, nice camerawork - but weak storytelling ultimately reduces the film's potential.",6/10
Tár (2022),"Director Todd Field is undeniably up to something different with his new film 'Tar'. Though what it is he's actually up to, what his goal is, I couldn't say. One thing for sure, It's strange. Very. And another thing for sure, it don't work.Proof?The first seven minutes are dedicated to scrolling the film's credits. No, not credits for Kate Blanchette and the rest of the cast. I'm talking about Key Grip, Best Boy, Stunt Man #1: the stuff you normally see at a film's conclusion: if you stick around for the credits.The film's next fifteen minutes feature a one on one interview between the film's protagonist Ms. Tar (Blanchette) and New Yorker Columnist Adam Gopnik (playing himself). The two are seated on an auditorium's stage, the audience silent, Ms. Blanchette / Tar fiercely intense as the Philharmonic Conductor describes her craft. This goes on far longer than you expect. And, in my opinion, far longer than necessary.The next segment is a lunch or dinner at which Ms. Tar and an associate (Who is he? I don't know. But I should.) discuss the politics and interpersonal relationships going on in Ms. Tar's Orchestra: The Berlin Philharmonic. The viewer is a fly on the wall to this gossip. We have to listen closely because much is mumbled. But never mind: the people gossiped about are people we don't know (yet) and so we - as in 'I' - tune out (perhaps a mistake but I could not help it). There are innuendoes a'plenty here; we learn that Ms. Tar is a lesbian and the man sitting across from her might be, or might once have been, attracted to men.Here, at about the thirty to forty minute mark, I considered leaving. But I didn't. You, however, may give in to the inclination to draw fresh air and frankly I would not blame you. But if you do consider leaving, let me tell you this:1. The rest of the film moves at a faster pace. Much faster. In fact the longer it goes, the faster the pace.2. Ms. Blanchette is, in fact, as fabulous as you've undoubtedly read. If you do stay, stay for her performance, not the story.3. The gossip you overheard at that lunch / dinner table? As the film progresses it will begin to make sense to you. Completely? No. But somewhat.4. Conductor Tar is a mighty presence with an 'Achilles Heel'. And that weakness has gotten her into a bit of trouble. But exactly what it is she did - I mean exactly - remains somehow vague. We never doubt her weaknesses, but would probably benefit from some more detail. Such as, What was her relationship to the person who got Tar into trouble. Was the person a student? A member of the symphony?5. The scenes of Blanchette / Tar conducting the orchestra are fine. They are not jaw-droppingly sensational (as other critics would have you believe). In short, I was. Disappointed.The way I see it, if you're reading this review it's likely you've already decided to see it. And if that's the case I hope this will assist you in adjusting your expectations. 'Adjusting', as in lowering.",5/10
Tár (2022),"""I am Petra's father...I am going to get you."" Lydia Tar (Cate Blanchett)Make no mistake, Tar is not about music: It is a fiction about naked power in the rarefied world of classical music conducting. As writer director Todd Field deftly orchestrates a drama that's almost a thriller about the first female conductor, Lydia Tar, in a major German orchestra, the audience is thrilled and mesmerized as if Leonard Bernstein (her mentor) were conducting Mahler in Lincoln Center.Cate Blanchett brilliantly becomes Tar, a world-renowned conductor, who has had stints from Cleveland to New York and finally Berlin. Blanchett is great enough to make the audience feel as if they had been intimate roommates with the maestro.No longer having to answer questions about gender, she commands with like a dictator from choosing orchestral leaders to changing a program to feature a potential lover soloing Elgar on a decidedly-different program dedicated to Mahler.When she dresses down a student at her Julliard lecture, she also handily deconstructs Bach's Prelude in C Major. She reveals in one incident her shredding personal side and her transcendent understanding of classical music.As the quote above displays, even in her personal life she exercises an outsized fearsomeness. She can dispatch her daughter's (Mila Bogojevic) bully with a force equivalent to conducting Mahler's Fifth (or ""the five"" as Lydia comfortably refers to it).When she asks permission from the orchestra to mount the Elgar, she is actually telling them that's what the program will be, at the same time informing them she's had to rotate out a beloved long-time player. Everyone is aware of the politics, especially her lust for a new cellist specializing in Elgar's Cello Concerto, replacing her assistant, Francesca (Noemie Merlant), who has seniority and maybe better skills. Yet Field, clearly schooled in Greek tragedy, loads the screenplay with hubris, the poison of numerous power players over the centuries.It's the conductor's old game in new times when social media will reveal peccadillos as well as crimes, real or figurative, and autocrats like James Levine and Lydia Tar cannot withstand the scrutiny.Because we have lived through all kinds of strong-man rule, from democracy-endangering fascism to indiscriminate pandemic, unfettered power seems eventually doomed to the moral demands of a populace chafing at the abuse of leadership for its personal gain, be it wealth or lust. It just takes a while for Nemesis to arrive.Tar may be the best film so far of 2022 and Blanchett the best actress. Start your Oscar adventure now in theaters with Tar.",5/10
Tár (2022),"I love Cate Blanchett. She is one of THE finest female actresses I know of in this time.

I hate that. But perhaps some others wont mind this at all.More bad: there is more troubling with this movie. The biggest let down of this movie is that it is VOID of ANY true DRAMA.It is one heck of a bore to watch. Anyone expecting anything extraordinary emotional to happen, forget about it.Long in the tooth, tedious, boring.Even the technical details of this movie (the photography) are painstakingly SLOW and UNEVENTFUL.I get it, I get it, this is suppose to be a subtle, character portrait.

Tár (2022),"How much you enjoy Tar will depend largely on how you feel about a film that begins with the credits. There's good reason for it (everything in Tar is considered down to the smallest detail) but if you can't get on board with that kind of self indulgence then you are in for a long two and a half hours.One of the reasons for beginning with the credits may be that we are about witness a career in reverse. An opening interview lets us know that Lydia Tar is at the top of her profession, a conductor with a dream resume and an EGOT who is about to complete her masterpiece symphony recording. Over the next couple of hours we see her slipping down the mountain as past deeds and the way she treats people in general come back to take a bite out of her perfect life.The film solely follows Kate Blanchett's Tar for the entire runtime, we see all events from her perspective and she is in every scene. Blanchett put its an astounding performance, indeed it is hard to imagine many, if any, other actors who could have been up to the task. That the whole show rests on such a powerful but subtle turn is Tar's greatest strength but also its only real weakness. Its a nuanced performance that fits perfectly but added to the characters flawed nature it can at times leave proceedings feeling cold and hard to connect with emotionally. Like its titular character Tar is a film of craftmanship and intellect not emotion, although the themes of hierarchy dynamics and abuse are powerful.If you can get on board with the full force filmaking style then you will find Tar a breathtaking wonder of a movie with something to think about in every scene and something to ponder long after the (second lot of) credits roll.9 successful recordings out of 10 symphonies.",9/10
Tár (2022),"Tár is a dense film. Thick with dialogue and emotional power. It's also a bit tricky to get in to and might be a bit much for the casual viewer. That's a shame though as it's great. Lydia Tár (Cate Blanchett) is a renowned concert conductor. An opening montage leads us into a live interview with the New Yorker, introducing her achievements to date. Let's just say it's a stellar CV. Right from the off, Tár is a force. Confident and assertive, but there are hints of the smallest of cracks. People will often misunderstand the role of a conductor, reducing it to something almost needless. Director and writer Todd Field knows this and lets that opening interview roll, as a device it not only introduces us to Tár, but the world of classical orchestration and her interpretation of it. Like I said, dense. At the top of her game, there's plenty of admirers, both publicly and professionally. Like Elliot Kaplan (Mark Strong) with a fantastic wig, who's told ""There's no glory for a robot, do your own thing"". Or a room full of nervous students at Juilliard, who also feel the wrath of Tár's uncompromising views. She's putting a lot of herself out there, is she as certain of herself as she appears though and when everything appears so perfect and controlled, what aren't we seeing. Those potential cracks show themselves through Francesca (Noémie Merlant), she's the assistant. Seemingly subordinate, she's clearly privy to some weakness, could be the weakness, or quite the opposite. Tár's partner Sharon (Nina Hoss) too. She has a fragility and brings out a tenderness in Tár, but there's something else. It's clear that Tár intends on retaining her position, status, power. Ruthlessly if required. These personal moments though really help the flow of this film. Although slightly bleak, they're a breath of fresh air in Tár's austere world. It's a beautiful world though. Rooms vast with modernist lines and understated grandeur. I find myself lost in these spaces as Tár too begins to ebb. I can imagine that classical music students might lap the opening acts up, it feels important. Is it though, or is it an impenetrable pretentious three hour indulgence. I'd say it's neither. It's a slow burning drama. That doesn't so much as unfold as gently slides into a darkness as Tár's facade crumbles. Accelerated by the arrival Olga (Sophie Kauer) a no nonsense Russian cellist, brought in to help a live performance recording of Mahler's Symphony No.5... but is anything but a stabilising presence. It demands your attention. Blanchett is incredible. It's an explosive performance. Utterly captivating. A singular pivotal presence. ""It's not a democracy"". She needs to be too. At not far off 3 hours, it's an intense experience. Be prepared to be patient, but you will be rewarded.",7/10
Tár (2022),"During the first minute of this film, Cate Blanchett shows what an extraordinary actress she is. Her character, star conductor Lydia Tár, is waiting to go onstage. There is no dialogue, only body language. But even without words, Blanchett shows what Tár thinks and feels.Blanchett's remarkable performance is a large part of what makes this a good movie. But there's more. The very clever script gives us a lot to chew on afterards. Tár is a woman in the men-dominated world of classical music. She's not warm, empathic or even very sympathetic. In fact, she has many characteristics that are usually associated with men. She's vain, selfish and manipulative. And that's what gets her in trouble. At the start of the film, she seems to be one of the most admired women in the world. She is extremely famous and successful. At the end, everything has fallen apart.The film doesn't judge. It leaves it up to the viewer to decide if Lydia Tár is a victim or a culprit. Or maybe both at the same time. The viewer gets a lot of information to make up his (or her) mind. Director Todd Field gives us the story elements slowly, bit by bit. Take the scene where Lydia Tár gives a stern speech to a young girl who bullies her daughter. It shows that she is used to getting everyone in line, according to her wishes. That's useful information to interpret things later on in the movie.Tár is very much a modern movie. It has things to say about gender, about power, about social media, about being woke. But at the same time, it's a very old-fashioned movie. It takes its time. There are long scenes, and long takes. There's nothing modern in the way it is filmed. And that's a good thing.",8/10
Tár (2022),"If you can get through the first hour it's worth staying to the end, as success and love and friendships are all shattered and descend, as the people who helped make her come to terms with what she's done, the crescendo building slowly then exploding like a drum.A familiar story through an original perspective, at its heart a breath taking central performance that will undoubtedly win many a reward and be recalled as one of her greatest, although the length of the production is excessive and, if you're not a fan of classical music it may temper your enjoyment, although I'm sure you'll be intrigued by the orchestral manoeuvres, both in the dark and the light.",8/10
Tár (2022),"Tar is a masterpiece, and certainly one of the best films of the year. It is slow-paced and therefore not for everyone, but it is very much for discerning audiences willing to think.While profoundly immersed in the world of classical music, the film is not a social observation of that community. It is a film about how extraordinary talent is imperfect and how in today's world that talent will be canceled, mainly for all the human defects that ultimately make them the geniuses they are. The film does not provide easy answers -the main character Lydia is very far from perfect- but much like a piece of music by Bach commented by Lydia in the film, it puts emphasis on questions and not answers, because ""only questions are heard"".Beautiful, deep writing, exceptional acting, directing, cinematography are all at play in Tar. And while one wonders midway through the film what its point is and where it is trying to go, it all comes together in the end, and you realize that the point had never escaped the filmmaker, who through his main character had been insisting repeatedly that the most important thing in a piece of music (and by extension art) is to always understand its intent.Tar is the right film at the right time.",10/10
Tár (2022),"An orchestra legend Lydia Tar is a wife, mother, music teacher, and masterful leader!

Lydia was selfish at times and remarkable at being professional; at the same time she heard random sounds at night or during a run I believe her work consumed her Cate Blanchett extraordinary for everything. I really like too how Cate did her own stunt work at least with driving. Incredible experience all around highly recommend to most anyone.",9/10
Tár (2022),"I went to this movie with great anticipation. As a classical music devotee, I was also anxious to see how it figured into the narrative. Yes, Cate Blanchett is fantastic in an Oscar-worthy performance, and other actors are fine as well. But good acting in a bad film isn't enough. The film is a tedious, pretentious mess, and worse, for the first two hours, it's boring. (For someone who knows or cares little about classical music, it must be painful.) Short scenes interspersed within the narrative are neither meaningful nor symbolic-- they just go nowhere and feel like self-indulgent artsiness. We learn much about Tár's ascendency to the top tier of her profession (as if someone is reading her Wikipedia page to us) but learn nothing about why Tár is the miserable human being she is. If it's simply meant to be a portrait of an unlikeable, imperious, narcissistic, and cruel personality, it generally succeeds. If it's a commentary of ""me-too"" and cancel culture, it's superficial at best. If we're supposed to care about her or her life, it fails. James Levine--been there, done that.",4/10
Tár (2022),"What a let-downVisually nicely shot but ultimatly very, very boring and 30 min too long. A lot of the banal convos could have been shorter or ommitted. Nothing really happens. You dont even get to listen to classical music that much. Also, forcing the audience to sit through 10 min of reverse closing credits at the beginning of the movie is pretentious.Cate wasn't right for this part, uncomfortably overacting. You could see the acting. Very mannered and over the top. A master class in delivering lines. Monotonous and passionless. That's all.Tilda Swinton would have been perfect but not sure she could have saved this overlong non-story.",3/10
Tár (2022),"Todd Fields made one of the best directing debuts ever in 2001 with ""In the Bedroom"". His latest feature doesn't quite live up to those standards, but the stylistic undercurrent is still there. The increasing neurosis and paranoia of the of the well-to-do protagonist, seeming to be undone by their toxic environment, is a through line to his previous features.Howard Hawks once said that a good movie has three great scenes and no bad scenes. Tár has three good scenes, and the rest are tolerable. The opening is middling, and the editing is choppy and lacks a strong pace. But Cate Blanchett's portrayal is enough to bring about the audience's sympathy of being a scapegoat, while some dramatic tension is revealed in the sequences at Juilliard, the deposition, and an unexpectedly creepy moment when Linda is pursued through a dark, dank basement. Unfortunately the film never quite comes together to unify into a cohesive hole.",5/10
Tár (2022),"'Tár', one of the most talked about films of 2022 and a serious contender for the Academy Awards, with six nominations, is written and directed by Todd Field - a filmmaker who does not seem at all rushed or prone to accumulate impressive numbers in his filmography. In fact 'Tár' is only his third feature film and it is made 16 years after the previous one. The fictional biography of a great musician - symphony orchestra conductor - 'Tár' seems and was written for Cate Blanchett and suits her to such an extent that after watching it it is hard to imagine another actress in this role. It's a complex and loooooong film (yes, that's its main problem!) which in almost three hours of projection manages to bring to the screen a multitude of problems related to the world of great musicians and the way they combine their careers with their personal lives, about the place of women in a competitive world where private lives are scrutinized and mistakes are not forgiven, about the role of media and social networks in celebrity careers, and about political correctness and its verdicts in the public square of the Internet age. Above all, however, it is a film about the power games in the fascinating and complicated world of great art.The titular heroine of the film, Lydia Tár, seems to be a model of success in every way. A student of Leonard Berstein, she is one of the world's great conductors, winner of all possible awards, principal conductor of the Berlin Orchestra and professor at Julliard. She has, of course, had to work hard and fight fiercely for this position, as a woman and as a lesbian (her partner is the concertmaster of the orchestra), but the beginning of the film catches her at her peak and the past is not mentioned until it begins to insinuate in the present. Relationships with his daughter, an elementary school student, indicate traumas in the distant past. A conductor with whom she had a more recent relationship pursues her obsessively, and Lydia retaliates by blocking her artistic career. Her position of power seems to allow all but also requires her to make decisions that do not always seem completely professionally motivated. Sometimes it seems that she uses her power to fuel personal passions, but everything happens in an ambiguous zone. Her faithful assistant is skipped by her from a promotion, an instrumentalist in the orchestra is loses to a younger candidate the opportunity to perform a concert, in one of the lessons at Julliard she adopts a very politically incorrect attitude in a dialogue with a student. These are small and debatable incidents, but in all cases the decisions are hers alone. Perfectionism can be a great quality of a conductor who must have absolute control over every sound, tempo and nuance in a concert or recording. But life is more complicated, even than a Mahler symphony.Director Todd Field seems to have drawn himself inspiration from his character, making some creative decisions that influence how the film looks. However, not all of them are for the benefit of the movie, some seemed questionable to me. The film begins with the credits that usually roll at the end, when the lights come up and the audience leaves the theater. It's a nice sign of respect for the technical team, but should this take precedence over the spectators in the cinema halls? The length of the film far exceeds that of Mahler's symphonies. Yes, this is the fashion in Hollywood, but here I feel that more brevity would have served the film. The first half hour seems like a docu-drama (an excellent one, by the way) about the life of a great musician, and another hour or so passes - spent in the stratosphere of the world of great musicians, in concert halls and luxurious apartments where the pianos don't even fill the spaces, until the drama really kicks off. Indeed, when events rush headlong, we are dealing with a genuine drama, which calls into question the entire world of intellectual and material luxury in which we had been immersed until then. The filming style also changes, from documentary style and long one-shots (see the Julliard scene) in the first part, to nervous editing with action film techniques. Neither the world of music with its intrigues and power games, nor that of the media and social media that can destroy lives and careers come out well in the story conceived by screenwriter Todd Field. The generosity in duration allows for the construction of several memorable roles - mostly feminine. I don't know if Cate Blanchett will get the Best Actress Academy Award this year again (it would be her third time), but her role seemed to me one of the best of a career in which I don't remember any failures or miscasts. I'd rather bet on the award for original script. We will see. In any case, 'Tár' is one of the most interesting films of the year, but also one of those that demands the attention and patience of the viewers. Using, again, the metaphor of Mahler's music, just as his symphonies are not liked by every classical music-loving audience, this film is not intended for every moviegoer. But those who like it, will like it a lot.",8/10
Tár (2022),"This film uses the conventions of a documentary to explore its subject. The narrative progresses in small scenes, which are not always connected, but as we have seen this reality type format before, the viewer is acquainted with how to approach the film. It contains drama inasmuch as daily life has its moments, although it is not to be counted on to be interesting.The duration, at over two and half hours, imposes on the viewer the smug opinion that this is a serious subject about a worthy person, as if we were following a real conductor in the hallowed concert halls of classical music. However, like most of the material here, the duration is not enough to convince when there are too many longueurs, although there are moments where the politics of the orchestral world are reasonably credible. It does provide a pleasant passing scene where our fiery conductor tells a young musician his attitudes are uninformed and anachronistic. It's still not quite enough to put the popcorn down, though.The principal character is established with a quite preposterous career history. This element plays to an American cultural aesthetic. Tár is, a quasi-divine blend of mother creator and Fortune 500 CEO and makes her and the film, unbelievable. But then we are in such a rarefied cultural world that the project recording of Mahler's 5th implies that CDs have larger capacity than is possible.There are two eminence grises to this film. The first is Lenny Bernstein: his Mahler recordings are cited and he's mentioned in other places too. His identification with Mahler and his own ego - watch the 1981 Munich ''Tristan und Isolde'' - for insufferable conductor megalomania, provide the template in some degree to this movie. He still exercises a thrall which needs overturning.The second presence is the gigantic ego of Ayn Rand. She still exercises influence on the American comprehension of creative force, despite her own books being unreadable dross. Blanchett's performance channels Rand's supreme solipsism, for which she was infamous, and therefore has the ''charm'' associated with Rand's objectionable personality.A pretentious and dull film which proves again that Mahler and movies are a difficult proposition; something that executives knew in 1971 with ''Death in Venice'', though they did inquire if was still available to score other films.",4/10
Tár (2022),"If you are not familiar with classical music, probably almost the entire first hour will be very difficult to sit through. The dialogue is PACKED with references to classical music artists/works/history/etc. Not to mention there are constant little allusions to different plot threads which make up Tar's whole story.However, this dies down gradually and the movie becomes much more focused and simple. Blanchett is incredible, but not in a showy way at all. Her conducting moments were awesome. The story is political and relevant, and handled very well and balanced-like.There is a surprisingly creepy vibe to the film, that borders on something almost like a horror movie at times. It's quite unnerving.One of the best movies i've seen all year! Probably Todd Field's best work yet.",8/10
Tár (2022),"I was really excited to see this movie especially as someone who loves classical music and Cate Blanchett as an actressHowever it clearly shows that if a script is terrible and the directing is way too long winded the film just falls apart regardless of how great of an actress Cate is to try to carry this monstrosity of tedicious boredomThe first act is as slow as molasses and sure we all want to see this wonderful conductor character built up
but it gets so tedious and meticulous in odd details that don't really matter - and unlike films like whiplash that keep you excited and interested in the music and the character- this one actually feels more like a Porsche car commercial mixed in with a conductors daily earring -sleeping and even bathroom habits - and very little to do with music and what inspired her to become such a narcissist- so as a character development story it falls apart until the third act which unfortunately is rushedI give it only 4 stars because about 30 minutes could've been edited and this film should have been under 90 minute movie and been more effectiveKudos to Cate and to Porsche promos4 stars.",4/10
Tár (2022),"This is a movie in the Stanley Kubrick tradition in that it is challenging, works on different levels and reveals new insights on each viewing. I think this will be a classic some day. But it is not easy viewing.Here are some random thoughts I've had after two viewings...The opening text exchange between Krista and Francesca: On first viewing I assumed it was Krista who was still in love with Tar. But after studying it closely I think it is actually FRANCESCA who is still in love with Tar. That then explains Francesca's odd behavior around Tar and the doodles she makes such as Tar/Rat. That also gives her character much more motivation to destroy Tar (which she does.) Krista, who I originally thought committed suicide due to her rejected love for Tar actually killed herself because her career was sabotaged.I was on the fringes of the classical music world in NYC socially. I found Blanchette's portrayal of such an accomplished conductor completely unconvincing. The way she talked did not sound to me like someone who really lives and breathes classical music. So I thought her acting from that perspective was pretty bad. But maybe it was deliberate? Tar is such a phony. Was she even really friends with Lenny or did she just know him on videotape? I suspect that some of her dialogue might even be lifted from some of Bernstein's television shows. Was she, dare I say it, a beneficiary of what we call ""equity"" today? Did she get to where she was partly because she was a woman? Also, during the early ""Inside the Actor's Studio"" style interview she is treated more like a celebrity than an artist.The movie opens with closing credits and some beautiful music I believe that Tar had recorded during her stint in Peru. The fact that she spent those years in Peru was the one truly likeable/redeeming aspect of her character. So while the film is kind of like a classical tragedy where an exalted human being crashes to earth via their own behavior, the truth is that THIS IS A MOVIE WITH A VERY HAPPY ENDING. The person Tar becomes at the end of the movie is the person she was before all the BS of success turned her into a monster. Her downfall has saved her. She is a very likeable person at the end...one who is not too proud to take on such a ""demeaning"" job and who treats it with the same enthusiasm she gave to Mahler. I think that those who think the ending is sad or a punishment are missing the point. Which brings us back to the closing credits being at the start. If you think of the movie playing backward from the end to the beginning, it is the story of a good human being being turned into an absolute monster. So the movie is a tragedy when played backward which is why the ending credits are at the start. But played forward the movie is actually not a tragedy. It is a story of redemption.I have the feeling I will be analyzing this movie for the remainder of my life!",8/10
Tár (2022),"When did they start thinking that it was ok to make a movie centered around negative, egoistical, sociopathic characters? Since a new wave of directors in the 70s decided they wanted to break the rules? Remember: there are no rules, but you break them at your own peril.Sorry it may sound old hat but I do believe a movie is much stronger when you can totally empathize with the main character. A main character can be ambiguous (unless you are into the immature superhero SFX extravaganza), weak or even a perfect loser, but a sociopath? What do we care about them?I am flabbergasted by the fact that Todd Field took so long to write this. He wanted Cate Blanchett to play the part, great, she did it, she just bought into the project and trusted the director to know what story he was telling.Having Cate Blanchett doesn't mean you can do anything. SHE can play anything obviously, but what a waste of talent and energy to just bundle this in a story from the POV of this character who appears less and less positive as the story progresses.To me this could have been a masterpiece - carried in no small way by the same cast performance shoed in by the same direction - if only the movie had quickly switched to an external point of view: assistant Francesca or wife Sharon. Someone we could empathize 100% with, not someone we would feel gradually 100% estranged from.This basic mistake works like reverse chemistry: everything is in place after the (quite heavy) exposition in the New Yorker public interview, then each time Lydia Tar takes a plane to and from Berlin we lose some interest, some proximity with her.The buzz-worthy Julliard sequence is the most important part of the movie. It works perfectly well, the overwhelming professionalism crushing the uncompromising wannabe pretentiousness. It is very strong. You cannot but love this buoyant personality and take sides for this sharper-than-frame character. Her lecture is just the opposite of pedagogy, either you know the answers or you just shut up and listen. But you want more, you are craving to be lectured flat.Unfortunately this masterful sequence is then buried under layer after layer where the viewer is just an accessory to more and more destructive sociopathic behaviour.Cate Blanchett + supporting cast: 5/5.Todd Field's script and other creative choices: 1/5.",6/10
Tár (2022),"Lydia Tar seems to have it all. As she is introduced in an interview that opens the film, she is music director of a prestigious Berlin orchestra (and the world-leading female conductor), music composer, winner of the EGOT, and founder of an institute to train female conductors, etc. At home, she has a female partner, and together they are raising a child who is fond of her. But some past incidents come to haunt her.Cate Blanchette is mentioned a lot in earlier reviews for her acting, and I agree that she gives an excellent, believable performance in the role. However, there is more than acting that goes into a film. There is the story.One thread running thru the film is her rehearsals of the Mahler 5th Symphony. This is supposed to be her crowning achievement in recording, completing the full cycle of 9 Mahler symphonies with the same orchestra, in a covid-delayed live recording. I assume that the 5th was chosen for plot purposes, rather than a larger one with requirements for a choir, and also short enough to require a companion piece. Again, I assume for plot purposes, the selection of a companion piece was delayed until rehearsals for the 5th were almost complete, rather than being programmed a lot earlier, and a soloist (if needed) hired.As a donor to my local symphony, and so a seasoned attendee at rehearsals, I find the rehearsals authentic. That includes decisions like tempo, the balance between sections of the orchestra, and moving the opening trumpet solo offstage. Intriguingly, when Tar speaks to the orchestra in German, subtitles are omitted, which somewhat parallels the experience of being at a rehearsal, since the audience does not hear all of what the conductor is saying.At over 2-1/2 hours, the film is long, but reasonable. There is a sub-plot showing a different part of her world collapsing on her. Move importantly, her character has time to develop to show that the accusation against her are credible. There are mentions of real-world conductors being fired for sexual improprieties, but casting all-female principals nicely strips the gender differences away, leaving it to simply power and opportunity.",9/10
Tár (2022),"Complex and grey, this is a film not for modern audiences who have become accustomed to baby food and a distinction between black and white typical of MCU movies or cartoons. This is a portrait and analysis of a multidimensional character who asks us to reflect on all her behavior and draw our own conclusions about her, power dynamics, and our society. There have been several times that she has gone beyond ethically acceptable behavior. Others were the moments when there was a hypocritical reaction - either from those around her looking to move up in life (having the same type of transactional relationship, even knowing the effects of Lydia in others) or from those who feel ultra offended by whatever every day.Cate Blanchett is the perfect actress to play this Lydia Tar and has an incredible performance, conveying to us many of the emotions she hides from the audience, even before the full breakdown. Her fears, her tics, her meanness, her insecurities, her arrogance, her competence. Everything is passed on to us and we see a whole human being. Despicable in much of what she does, but complete. Nina Hoss is another highly valued actress who, without having to cry in every scene, says everything she needs to and convinces in what she conveys through subtle and realistic reactions and dialogues.The direction of Todd Field is strong, with some interesting shots and camera movement that even surpasses what the action shows us (as in some dialogue scenes). Sometimes the conversation around musical elements is exaggerated for those who want nothing to do with it, but, understandably, it is necessary to tell us about that world. Sometimes the script and plot seem to take a predictable path and that may be the biggest flaw of this. However, this is a very good movie, with excellent technical elements, which I want to revisit very soon.",8/10
Tár (2022),"From Little Children to TÁR, Todd Field's first film in 16 years didn't disappoint. A slow-paced drama with a powerful performance from Cate Blanchett is a good watch. The first hour and a half of the film establishes Lydia Tár, a renowned composer-conductor, her accomplishments and position in society. However, almost completely of her own doing, her life fell apart.Cate Blanchett's performance made this film a contender. She carried a very decent portrayal of an artist whom you thought was contented with life and success but was looking for something more. And that ""more"" caused a downfall no artist in real life has survived from. This film gave us a glimpse of what it's like for an artist when their career starts to fall apart, and their works and achievements become overshadowed by actions they have done. The ""Can you separate the art from the artist?"" argument is what makes this film a thought-provoking experience.",7/10
Women Talking (2022),"Well intended is simply not good enough - not for a moment Women Talking convinced me that I watch real women in a real situation talking real. What I got is some stage play, based on a real life tragedy, with some lecturing and then some more. So I got rather pretty fast bored. Women Talking is one of those movies made these days to get some awards and the applauds by the right kind of people, and will be forgotten in a few years from now. The movie somewhat remembers me of Dogville (starring Nicole Kidman), directed by Lars von Trier - that movie had a lasting impression on me, despite being set up like a stage play, it got me from the first moment, kept my interest, entertained me, and well, the acting also beats the cast of Women Talking. By the way, I don't believe that some transgender man or woman would be accepted in that kind of community, but well, protocol for inclusion must be followed... Bon appétit.",4/10
Women Talking (2022),"Greetings again from the darkness. Do nothing. Stay and fight. Leave. Those are the three options a group of women debate in the loft of a barn on the edge of their religious commune. The true story that inspired Miriam Toews to write her 2018 novel is horrific. Between 2005 and 2009, there were more than 150 cases of females being drugged (with livestock tranquilizers) and violently raped. They ranged in age from three to sixty-five, and this occurred in a deeply religious Mennonite community in Bolivia. The great writer-director Sarah Polley has adapted Ms. Toews' novel for her first feature since STORIES WE TELL (2012), and we welcome her back as a voice always deserving of a platform.When two girls spot a rapist running away one evening, an emotional fire is lit. The man is charged, and this leads the women to organize their own meeting to discuss the three options noted above. Rooney Mara plays Ona, the good-hearted optimist. Claire Foy plays her sister Salome who spends much time in rage mode. Jessie Buckley is Mariche, the often brutally abused woman who has her own strong ideas. If you are a movie lover, you immediately recognize that these three are among the best young actresses working today. What a pleasure to watch them do what they do ... despite the material often being extremely uncomfortable and stress-inducing. This new generation of community women are joined in debate by the elders: Agata (Judith Ivey) and Greta (Sheila McCarthy), who both carry the burden of shame having raised their daughters in this environment. Scarface Janz (Oscar winner Frances McDormand, also a producer on the film) only has a couple of scenes, as she is stays strong in her ""do nothing"" stance.As the dialogue continues in the loft, we learn much about what these women, as well as the generations before them, have endured. Over the years, whenever victims have spoken up about the horrible abuses, their accusations have been dismissed as ""wild female imagination."" The religious patriarchy has led to many years of submission and resignation to a lesser life - one that includes manual labor and a lack of education. These women cannot read or write, so they have asked August (an excellent Ben Whishaw) to take notes and list the pros and cons of the options. August is a gentle soul and the local schoolteacher who has an eye towards Ona.Revenge, forgiveness, protecting one's self and their children is all part of the discussion, as is the difference between fleeing and leaving. These women are finding their voice through the strength of each other. Cinematographer Luc Montpellier uses mostly black and white with some subtle color gradation for effect, as well as a contrast between interior (barn loft) shots and those of the outdoor vistas and fields (representing the outside world). The score from Hildur Guonadottier is heavy on strings and works perfectly for the story, and the inclusion of ""Daydream Believer"" from The Monkees is a welcome inclusion.We don't normally think of cinema as watching people sit around and talk. One of the best ever movies showing debate among adults is 12 ANGRY MEN, and this film takes a similar approach and is not far off from the level of that all-time classic. The courage of those real women from Bolivia was staggering, and Sarah Polley offers up this intellectual and thought-provoking approach to these women taking stock of their situation. It's a gut punch, yet somehow inspiring.Opens in theaters on January 13, 2023.",8/10
Women Talking (2022),"I'll admit up front that this is likely going to be an unpopular review and a decidedly minority opinion, but I have to be honest about my feelings. Writer-director Sarah Polley's adaptation of Miriam Toews's novel of the same name may come from a place of noble intent, and it may feature one of the year's finest acting ensembles, but its overall treatment is a major misfire. This fact-based story about a group of women from a conservative religious colony who meet to discuss how to respond to a series of sexual assaults in their community unfolds in a circular, wooden, stagey fashion that plays more like a university discussion group than a work of dramatic cinema. The ideas raised in these dialogues - ranging from activism to passivity to intergender relations to forgiveness to faith and salvation - are certainly lofty topics for consideration and deliberation, especially in terms of how they might be addressed in the forging of a new and better world. But their handling here is so forced and inauthentic that the entire exercise lacks believability and does little to foster a sense of concerted viewer engagement. And, as the narrative drones on and on, it becomes tediously dull, with one of the characters herself astutely observing that ""This is very, very boring"" (well said, if a bit ironic). What's more, a number of incidents and themes seemingly arise out of nowhere and aren't always fully resolved, making one wonder why they were included in the first place. Even more disappointing is the fact that the film features so many fine portrayals by performers who are given such stilted material to work with, including Jessie Buckley, Claire Foy, Judith Ivey, Sheila McCarthy, Ben Whishaw and Frances McDormand (whose appearance is more of an afterthought than anything else). Director Polley has certainly made a name for herself with such excellent past works as ""Away From Her"" (2006), but her reach has certainly exceeded her grasp with this undertaking, one that has much to say but ultimately says so little.",5/10
Women Talking (2022),"20 minutes into 'Women Talking' a character says ""this is very, very boring."" And I thought, I couldn't have reviewed this film any better than that. Boy this was a struggle to get through. It had absolutely nothing going for it.The film is one of the blandest visual experiences I've ever sat through. I'm not someone who needs the visuals to be great in a film, so the fact that I noticed it really says something. Not only is there basically only one (very dull) setting for the entire film, the colour is also saturated to near black and white. My eyes were begging for something interesting to look at.The film is extremely dialogue heavy as you may have guessed from the title. The problem is that none of it is interesting. And a lot of it is painfully pretentious. Lines like ""I sometimes wonder if people laugh as hard as they'd like to cry."" Lines that sound great until you give them a moments thought and realise how stupid they are.This is comfortably the shortest run time of the 2023 Best Picture nominees and yet it feels like one of the longest.

Women Talking (2022),"I wouldn't normally bother to come on here and speak the negatives because, well, who cares? But as there are so few doing it I have to lend my voice. Beautifully well shot and acted, this is easily the dullest time I have had at the cinema in this, admittedly short, 2023 so far. With the splendid reviews (thanks Jim Schembri for being the lone voice on RT) and the stellar cast I was really looking forward to it, and to be fair the visuals and the initial mystery, plus the intriguing, horrid flashes of the crimes being referred to, did hold me fast for the first act. But alas, the second act was merely a repetition of the first, with the same boring conversation ongoing, that stellar cast merely masking the fact that these characters are as paper thin as any from a junky superhero movie. It got no better as it crept sombrely towards the finale, which couldn't have come sooner for me. It does what it says on the tin, so if you'd like to see some women talking, about the same thing, in a barn, for an hour and three quarters, fill your boots.A few marks for the acting, the score (which really was clever - what a waste) and the cinematography: 4/10.",4/10

The elderly woman reminds them to forgive the attackers, lest the women be expelled from the colony and hence ne denied access to heaven. In a vote on what to do, it is a tie between ""stay and fight"" and ""leave"". The women debate what to do...

Here she brings us the true story of how a group of women in a remote colony in Bolivia deals with the horrible events that have happened to them. I love Polley's earlier work, and based on the movie's trailer and the strong endorsement by a friend who just saw it, I went into this with high expectations. Alas, it didn't work out very well. I guess I should've taken a hint from the movie's title, but it's really exactly that: a group of women talking (about staying and fighting, or leaving), for the entire freaking movie! I feel very let down, if not manipulated, by the movie's trailer, which gave no indication that this is at its core a filmed stage play, where we watch a group of women debating on their next steps after suffering unspeakable crimes. I fully realize that watching this type of movie is a very subjective experience. Unfortunately I couldn't get into it AT ALL.""Women Speaking"" opened in limited US theaters in late December so as to qualify for the Oscars, and now has been rolled out. The Sunday matinee theater screening where I saw this at was attend so-so (I counted about 10-12 people, the vast majority of them women). ""Women Speaking"" garnered 2 Oscar nominations (Best Movie, Best Adapted Movie Script).

Women Talking (2022),"I was so bored watching this film. It was a shame to see so many great and brilliant actors struggle with a script in which most of the dialogue was composed of stilted, stiff and awkward preaching. All the action takes place off screen and the actors talk about what happened off screen. We really wanted to like this and tried to see it through to the end but could not stand the tedious slog. Certainly a worthy subject. Too bad it was not served well by this production.

Women Talking (2022),"This film affected me powerfully. My childhood was overshadowed by a volatile father of whose potential for violence we lived in fear. He wasn't a drunk, so, compared to many who lived and live in such circumstances, I guess I got off lightly. But my mother didn't. And this is what WOMEN TALKING suddenly brought back to me. The helplessness of her situation, at a time when divorce was hard to get unless you had money, and even then carried a shroud of shame.On the day I write this, the Taliban in Afghanistan have banned women from universities. A woman's life in that country is structurally little different from that lived by the women depicted in Sarah Polley's film. It may have a period setting, but it could be many women's lives today.WOMEN TALKING counterpoints beautiful expanses of farmland with unspeakable cruelties.

Claire Foy, Jessie Buckley, Rooney Mara, Ben Whishaw, Judith Ivey, and Sheila McCarthy all deserve to be mentioned by name. The movie aches with feeling, and my heart went out to these women who just want to live their lives and practice their faith but can't because of rules imposed on them that they didn't have a vote in creating.A lot of people are whining about the washed out color scheme, but I don't get it. It matches the mood perfectly, and it's not at all distracting.And this has to feature the best use of the song ""Daydream Believer"" perhaps in film history.Grade: A+",10/10
Women Talking (2022),"When critiquing a film as heavily thematic as this, it is important to put your personal convictions on the back burner and try to analyze the piece as objectively as possible. It is difficult to do, considering WOMEN TALKING's entire identity is dependent on those themes, so I will still be talking about it toward the end, if anyone prefers not to read on. But first, let's analyze the clinical.This was a thoughtful, decorated cast from all different backgrounds. However, I couldn't say the acting was particularly good. Some members of the ensemble were clearly only cast for having unique, Mennonite style appearances, yet they did not have the acting chops to tackle a drama of this weight. The others who certainly did have the talent, as shown by their previous work, were not well directed. Ironically, the best performance of this cast happened to be the only biological male, a rather sad and counterproductive realization, considering the elements of female empowerment this movie was trying to invoke. I will give more details on him later.The cinematography was rough. They opted to use a very obvious filter to darken every scene. It was immediately annoying that they didn't choose to experiment with practical mood lighting, but around the one-hour mark it simply became unbearably distracting.The weakest element had to come from the writing. It wasn't that the writing was poor; quite the contrary. We knew from the beginning that these characters were uneducated. They say as much. They can't read, write, speak unless spoken to, and even free thinking is greatly discouraged. Despite all that, the written dialogue paints them as if they are all poets. Fluent, articulate vocabularies and vocal structure, all the exact same as one another, not to mention deep philosophical concepts and expressions. Good on Sarah Polley for being able to write so beautifully, but she didn't seem to understand the assignment.Now for the themes. WOMEN TALKING is clearly trying to be an allegory for female rage in our wider society, with each character acting as a surrogate for the various faces of victimhood. That is all well and good, but the point is lost by setting it within an isolated Mennonite colony (mind you, based on real events). It essentially serves as an admission that this level of misogynistic, religious zealotry is not common in the wider world, and therefore it is actively working against its own message. If the producers were married to that metaphor, they should have used more universally relatable source material.To be frank, the message can also be viewed as problematic. The talking points among the women include how all men should be held responsible for the few, as well as what age men could be considered ""dangerous"" or not. It is clear this movie is trying to make some outdated, generalized arguments against the wider demographic of men, with only two exceptions to the rule:There is Melvin, a trans man who changed his identity after an assault and miscarriage. The situation also pushed him to go selectively mute, a somewhat absurd development that is not reflective of how transgenderism actually works. Not to mention, a transgender man would never be allowed to stay in a Mennonite colony, so Melvin's inclusion in the ensemble further compromises the realism of the piece.The other ""good"" man is August. I mentioned him earlier. I know the actor well, particularly from his time doing Shakespeare. This is one of his first movies where he is given room to shine, and he certainly did. Even so, he is a rather small, soft spoken, and unintimidating actor. I think the inclusion of these two characters is trying to make the point that men don't have to be feared as long as they aren't masculine, another problematic idea about gender, but I digress.Despite August being one of the ""good guys,"" he is still treated horribly by the female characters. He is berated every time he speaks. Even when he actively refuses to share his opinion, they still use his refusal as a jumping off point about privilege. At the end, it is made clear that August was simply being used so he can ""teach"" the teen boys how to not be dangerous. They only ever treated August like a tool, not a person.At his best, the character of August served as an innocent punching bag for frustrated women. At his worst, August may not have even been so innocent at all. One could develop a theory that August was actually one of the assaulters all along, even impregnating his love interest while she was unconscious. The movie doesn't explicitly say this, just ever so subtle hints that I could still be misinterpreting. However, if that is the direction they were trying to go, it effectively ruins one of their most compelling characters and demoralizes the only positive adult male figure the movie has to offer.I think this movie was well intentioned, but it would have been better served as a thinking piece. Instead it was an exercise in anger, more screaming its ideas than discussing them. If it were better made, this could have been forgiven. Sadly, it was not.",4/10
Women Talking (2022),"""We are entitled to three things. We want our children to be safe. We want to be steadfast in our faith. And we want to think.""I thought that Frances McDormand and Sarah Polley handled the subject matter interlaced with subtle humour incredibly well. Sarah Polley's direction is flawless, particularly how she manages to capture the reaction shots of the characters. The cutaways are an interesting stylistic device incorporated in the movie, which should give the audience a glimpse of what happened to the characters and showcase the severity of the situation. The story was adapted from Miriam Toews 2018 novel, which is based on the real-life events that took place in 2011. In 2011, seven men from an ultra-conservative Mennonite colony in Bolivia were convicted of drugging and serially raping over 100 women from their community. The Mennonite colony was mostly populated by the descendants of the Eastern Europeans who settled there in 1874. The film sticks to the title (literally) and mainly takes place in a single setting. It is a self-contained story that speaks volumes and sparks conversations. The audience are drawn to the characters and want them to succeed, and to emancipate themselves from a heavily male dominated society. Throughout the course of the film, the women find themselves engaged in a conversation about whether they should stay, fight, or leave. I particularly enjoyed seeing Jessie Buckley fully in her element. I wouldn't be surprised if she gets nominated for an Oscar.Its meaningful colours, evocative mise-en-scene, beautiful cinematography, lively soundtrack, accurate costumes pertaining to the subculture, and overall mood makes ""Women Talking"" probably one of the most memorable cinematic experiences in my book. Hildur Guonadottir's score is phenomenal and evokes suspense and uneasiness. It also sort of has a chill-inducing effect on the spectator, whilst still being enthralled by the story. ""Women Talking"" may receive Oscar nominations in best production design, best original score, best screenplay, and perhaps best actress for Jessie Buckley or Claire Foy.The film benefits from having a star-studded cast with the likes of Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, Paddington himself Ben Whishaw, Jessie Buckley, and Frances McDormand. Although Frances McDormand only had a minor role in the film, she still was busy producing it behind the cameras.To conclude, Sarah Polley's ""Women Talking"" tells a story of oppression, trauma, and sexual assault. It showcases the power struggle between men and women, and how women find it difficult to emancipate themselves from men. Violence against women is still pervasive in today's society, but things are slowly improving. All the women are bound together by their traumatic experiences and try to eloquently put together their thoughts on the matter. Things start to escalate, tears are wept, words are exchanged, anecdotes are shared, and despite all that these women still have a sense of humour which is quite remarkable. All these women united to make a feminist statement and stand up to their oppressors.Other tidbits:*For me, the colour grading wasn't an issue, in fact it reflected on the overall mood of the film.*I adored the song ""Daydream Believer"" by the Monkees, played during the second act and end credits of the film. The song added a layer of positivity to the movie.*I was completely oblivious to the fact that Brad Pitt served as executive producer for the film.*Underappreciated characters: Ruth and Cheryl :)Final verdict: 9.4/10.",9/10
Women Talking (2022),"Powered by strong performances across the board, Women Talking follows the women of an isolated & ultraconservative community who take it upon themselves to decide the course of their future in the wake of a shattering revelation which compels them to reconcile their faith with their violent reality. Bracingly crafted & effectively told, it serves as a plea, a protest & a parable all at once.Written & directed by Sarah Polley, the story borrows its premise from a real-life event and the film is an imagined response to it - a reaction through fiction. The disturbing truth surfaces in gut-punching ways as the women argue & discuss their next move while snippets of their past adds more weight to their collective pain, rage, fear & trauma. It does get repetitive but it also gets the point across with clarity.The colour grading is an interesting choice, for it illustrates the bleakness of their existence in a colony ripe with unchecked male aggression but more could've been achieved with the camera. Still, what it lacks in cinematic qualities, it makes up in dramatic heft & strong emotional wallop, thanks to impressive work from the entire cast, ranging from Claire Foy's fierce rendition to Ben Whishaw's tender act, all enriching the narrative.Overall, Women Talking is a timely, topical & thought-provoking drama that brims with hate, hurt & heartbreak in its illustration of the horrifying reality of female experience but there is also hope for a better future despite the agonising brutality of their past & present. Though there was more up for grabs which it fumbles with its very own creative choices, the commitment from the cast & searing intensity of their inputs makes it an essential viewing.",9/10
Women Talking (2022),"In 2009, eight men in Manitoba Colony, a very conservative Mennonite community in Bolivia were convicted of drugging and raping 100 women in the community. Manitoba author Miriam Toews wrote the book ""Women Talking"" based on this incident.In the film adaptation, the men responsible for the attacks have been caught and turned over to the authorities. The men of the community have left to post bail for them. The women have been instructed to forgive them. They are all meeting while the men are away to consider their options because most don't feel they can simply forgive, but in refusing to do so, they face exile. A vote is taken and it's a draw between staying and contesting the men's position and leaving the community, so the women debate which course of action is best.This is a very well written and acted film. Some very profound ideas are discussed ... the nature of forgiveness, how to maintain faith if the main representatives of your fait are hopelessly corrupt, the importance of feeling heard and felling that your thoughts and feelings matter. The primary cast ... Jessie Buckley, Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, Judith Ivey, Sheila McCarthy ... all turn in wonderful performances. It's an extremely engaging and dramatic film, especially for one largely grounded in argument and discussion.It's not a particularly cinematic or visually compelling film, and it has some odd structural issues. That's not a very serious criticism, but it does hold the film back at times. It also is about 15 minutes longer than it should be. Still, it's a film that feels important, especially in the current cultural climate.",8/10
Women Talking (2022),"The fact that the movie is set in 2010 and is based on a true story is not easy to believe. The way things unfold, one would think it is at least in the 50s at the latest for the most part. But the way some cults work, and how people fall for them and spend generations in them is a sad truth of our world. Even though it can be technically called a chamber piece, it doesn't feel like one. There's so much in writing and directing that adds novelty to the story which is not exactly something groundbreaking. There are little moments throughout the film that makes the situation more weird and real at the same time that most films don't do.",8/10
Women Talking (2022),"Waste of good costume, talented cast, and good production over a nonsense, poorly written, fictional account of the most shocking incident to ever happen in a Mennonite Community. Don't watch this movie if you are expecting to gain insight over what really happened, or what life is really like living in an old world Mennonite community, because errors are abound.Front and foremost in the error department is the idea that none of these women can read or write. There is not a Mennonite Colony on this planet that forbids the education of women, this movie mistakes the Mennonites for Islamic Fundamentalists. No horse and buggy either as even the old world colonies allow motorized cars, this movie mistakes Mennonites for the Amish. And no, a bible-based religious community would not be tolerant of a young girl deciding to change her gender, she would have been excommunicated day one.Even if you ignore the errors and treat this as a fictional account in a fictional world, the movie still does not shine as the story is filled with plot-holes abound, which is surprising as there isn't much plot to begin with. Women who don't know how to read and write (or even know what a comma is) are well-versed in the Bible even to the point where they've memorized the chapters and verses of several passages. Lots of time is spent setting up story elements and relationship arcs that never pay off. In executing ""the decision"" It never factors in the scores of Men who were not the perpetrators, the movie downright ignores them as a plot element.Even if you ignore the plot/story altogether and treat this as a character study, the movie still does not shine. The dialogue is boring and mediocre as each character only says things meant to arouse sympathy and emotion from other characters. It feels like a cheap imitation of a melodramatic stage-play written in the '50s (and not one of the good ones either). It wastes runtime trying to find new ways and reasons for you to feel sorry for these characters, what was the point of this?There really is nothing worthwhile here, it feels like a sad attempt to exploit a real-life tragedy to promote an authors poor writing career, transformed into a movie that exploits a real-life tragedy to promote a fad social agenda. Please don't fall for this trap of a movie. Please don't mistake this for good craft or good art. 40 years from now, no one will look back at this movie and see anything of any value here.",3/10
Women Talking (2022),"It's an ensemble drama set within 24 hours in 2010 in an unknown location. It follows the conversation of three generations of women discussing how to respond to the sexual abuse and rape experienced by many women in the colony over the previous years.The conversation occurs while the colony's men are away in the city, raising bail for colony men arrested for sexual crimes. Eight women participate in most of the discussion. Two grandmother matriarchs are Agata (Judith Ivey) and Greta (Sheila McCarthy). The next generation includes Ona (Rooney Mara), an unmarried woman pregnant with a child resulting from rape. Mariche (Jessie Buckley) is married to a very abusive husband. Salome (Clare Foy) is Ona's younger married sister who is very angry over the abuse of her young daughter. Some girls from the next generation provide comments and some narration to the film. Scarface Janz (Frances McDormand), another matriarch, leaves the discussion early. Since the women are illiterate (only boys go to school), they ask the schoolteacher, August (Ben Whishaw), to record their discussion. August, who had left the colony with his mother, was university-educated but was allowed to return to teach school.The film shows no sexual violence but does show some results of the violence. The only adult male face seen throughout is that of August. The women discuss three options: staying and forgiving the perpetrators, staying and fighting the perpetrators, or leaving with all the children under a certain age. They must make a quick decision because one of the men is returning from the city in the evening. The decision taken by the group is a very ""Mennonite"" one.I had a lot of ambivalence going into the film. I didn't like the novel when I read it several years ago. The author closely tied the story to accounts of crimes in one of Bolivia's very conservative Mennonite groups. However, the novel's nuanced dialogue was far beyond illiterate Mennonite women without education who could not even read a map. And a university-educated August would never be allowed back to teach in such a conservative colony.Sarah Polley extracts the story from Mennonite specificity (the film never mentions the word and doesn't mention ""Mennonite"" last names). Polley uses very subdued colors in the filming, reinforcing the conservative impression. Although the movie's setting still looks Mennonite, its greater abstraction allowed me to focus on the issues being discussed--rage, forced ignorance, the necessity of faith and how to reconcile this faith with what happened, how best to embody their pacifist ethic, etc. The discussion is wide-ranging and doesn't provide easy and ready solutions. Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, and Jessie Buckley are excellent as they express contrasting and shifting perspectives.""Women Talking"" probably needs to be seen multiple times to get all the layers. The Mennonite context sells the movie, but for me, it only made sense to push that representation to the rear. I wish critics would focus on it less. The film's ending unfolds a little too slowly once their decision has been made.",8/10
Women Talking (2022),"There's two movies about sexual assault this year-this and the Harvey Weinstein based 'she said'. I found 'she Said' To be like watching 'spotlight' all over again. It didn't add anything new to the conversation. This does because of its nuances. It's easy to make a 'sexual assault bad' movie but this movie grapples within a religious faith based community where things aren't so black and white. I loved how all the characters represented all points of view-doing something about it, say nothing, etc. I love all the main cast-Claire foy, Jessie Buckley, Rooney Mara. Really great film done subtly on an important subject.",8/10
Women Talking (2022),"Women Talking (2022) is a movie that my wife and I saw in theaters last night. The storyline follows a group of women who live in the colonies, are separated from the men and families, aren't educated or schooled, and are regularly raped from the time they are little girls. They and left damaged, pregnant and with various diseases. They must decide as a group if this is a lifestyle they wish to continue, they want to leave or they want to stand and fight their attackers.This movie is directed by Sarah Polley (Take this Waltz) and stars Rooney Mara (Urban Legends: Bloody Mary), Frances McDormand (Fargo), Claire Foy (The Crown), Jessie Buckley (I'm Thinking of Ending Things) and Judith Ivey (The Devil's Advocate).The settings, attire, circumstances and characters in this are so unique, fascinating and sad all at the same time. The storytelling in this is very smart and well written. The ladies telling their stories, situations they've handled and outlook was tough. The horse story analogies were tremendous, the displays of blood and impact of situations were brutal and the backstory of the lost baby and brother was heart ripping. I will say the barn setting and discussions on what they should do ran long and was frustrating. You want to yell at the screen ""make a decision."" However, the resolve and ending was worthwhile.Overall, this is a very unique story with great characters and fascinating circumstances. This is an absolute must see that I would score an 8/10 and recommend seeing once.",8/10
Women Talking (2022),"You go to bed then wake up bruised, bloody, quite groggy and confused; you know instantly, that your body's been abused, your mind cannot conceive, all the torment and the grief, but you're not the only one, that's being used. So the women of the colony convene, to discuss the implications of what's been, carry on like there's no wrong, stay and fight which might prolong, or leave this place, put barriers between. The conversations, confrontations ebb and flow, the picture of what's taken place is shown, anguish, misery and despair, amongst a culture built on prayer, where the men have their own rules, own manifesto.It's a wonderful piece of filmmaking that engages from the outset with great dialogue, a disturbing story, and an empowering conclusion - with outstanding performances throughout.",8/10
Women Talking (2022),"""Women Talking"", which could, based on the film's impact, also be turned into a stage play here and there in the coming years, is one of the most successful movies from the year 2022 awards-wise and also one of the most talked-about. I cannot really share the praise, but I will get to that a little later. First of all, we shall mention the basics here. This movie is an American production in the English language and I am a bit surprise that Canada is not listed as a production country because the writer and director Sarah Polley is from Canada and so is Miriam Toews who wrote the book that this film is based on, even if her name does not exactly sound Canadian. I even checked if she is from my country Germany. Surely, she has connections to other parts of the planet. This film here runs for 104 minutes and this includes credits already, so it is actually not a very long watch at all, but also not super short. I mentioned Polley already. She surely deserves some more elaboration. She is in her early/mid-40s now and this means that she scored her first Oscar nomination for writing already before the age of 30 and now her second exactly 15 years later. I wonder if she has a shot at winning. I still think she looks younger than she is. Anyway, what is just as extraordinary about her career is her really, really long history of acting in front of the camera herself. She was really the epitome of a child actress for years, if not decades almost. Her last on-screen performance is from the year 2010 though, so as of now way more than a decade ago and it does not seem likely she will return. She has over 50 credits in her body of work there anyway, so no need to. As for writing and directing, she worked on a few short films early in her career, but the big breakthrough came with ""Away from Her"" that also brought her the aforementioned first Oscar nomination. She is surely not the most prolific writer and director though. If we ignore a TV series for which she directed a few episodes and a miniseries for which she is credited as writer, this is all she did in the last 10 years. Those happened back in 2017 and 2020.So yeah, an utterly interesting career this woman has and nice to see she is getting some appreciation now for her most recent work, even if I really wish this could have turned out better somehow. It is nothing unusual for her though that her works are often rather female-centered than male-centered, even if probably none of the previous releases fit this description to the same extent like this one here. Just look at the cast. Males are almost not existent. The one exception is of course Ben Whishaw that many may know from the 007 franchise and we will see if he stays a part of this when Craig's successor takes over. So he is also almost the biggest name from the cast here, especially with his recently very successful trip to the small screen, but the ones that are also in contention here are the Oscar-nominated Rooney Mara, who is the closest to a lead this film has and fittingly also a potential love interest to Whishaw's character, and also you could mention Claire Foy who had her biggest triumphs awards-wise on the small screen too, but has also made an impact for a while now on the big screen. I should mention Jessie Buckley as well with her recent Oscar nomination, but I feel she is not a big name (yet) and be it only because many have not seen the film for which she scored the Academy Award nomination.There is at least one more person from the cast who deserves a mention and that is of course Frances McDormand. She plays the only female character in here who in a way opposes the other women and who does not want to leave with them. But she also cannot force the young women living with her to do the same and she lets them go eventually. Her choice also has a lot to do with God. God is a constant factor in this film when the women discuss arguments if they should stay or go. With McDormand, it can be said that she is also a producer in here and the second nomination for this film came indeed in the biggest category, i.e. For Best Picture. So another Oscar nod for McDormand, even if the film does not have a chance to win there. I feel like this nomination also has to do with politically correct aspects of liberal Hollywood these days. It has happened a lot in the past that films with contemporarily relevant subjects are included for Best Picture, even if they lacked the quality in terms of most of the aspects to warrant such a nomination. I will not be cheering for Polley when it comes to Oscar night in the screenplay category. With McDormand, the producing nomination of course makes it obvious that in real life she fully sides with the characters in her movie and would be her own character's harshest critic. I think the film loses itself here and there in shock aspects that are not depicted too convincingly, but feel for the sake of it. Of course, it is terrible and despicable what happens to these women, but the first shot already how we see one of them in bed with bruises on her legs was not exactly to my liking. These really short shots (only a few seconds) that showed us how female character were bleeding down their legs were even worse. There are also good moments here for sure, like Mara's comment on one occasion that she still loves the baby in her belly more than anything else I liked, even if I feel that the film did not really do the actress justice. I think she is much better than what we see from her here and was a bit wasted talent-wise. Here and there, it also feels like she is grinning her way through the film.Kate Hellett I could mention too. I feel like she could have a good future in acting and she also has the right looks. The biggest problem I had here was the depiction of men though. Or I could say the elaboration as they were not really depicted at all. Surely, the ones who did this to the woman were full-on monsters, but generalizations are never a good thing, no matter what happened to them. Whishaw's character also disappointed me a lot from this perspective. The way how he is treated as the correct approach how men should behave is really cringeworthy. Apologizes from beginning end when he really does not have too, is literally only in this film to serve women and then he has this crush on Mara's character and of course he has no right to approach her in this film, but he has to serve the higher cause, namely to help the women with their organization and documentation when it comes to getting away from the place. It was just such a poorly-written character and it was impossible for me to take him serious at all. Does not say too much good about the actor either, especially when he is even insulted and attacked regularly by one of the women (I think it was Buckley's character) and he has no right to defend himself there. All he is allowed to do is apologize and obey. And he was an educated man even. Best/Worst example was when he elaborated on 14-year-olds towards the end. No words there what he says about his own gender. So yeah, there was a lot wrong with this film, most of it was linked to subtlety or the lack thereof. Just take the moment in which we are told that this story takes place in 2010 and not in 1910 or 1810 or earlier as you could guess as well with the way the women are living. This was surely shocking that stuff like this happens with no consequences at all in our time, but it felt off that they repeated the year immediately afterwards to make sure that everybody understood.Another letdown in this film was the trans character. It just felt really out of place and added nothing for me except a desperate desire from the writer to make another ""powerful"" statement linked to hot issues of our time. The fact that she was not talking, only to say something then in a really bizarre moment did not help either. It did not feel authentic to me. Actually, towards the end then, I thought that maybe something bad could happen to these women, that they get attacked or so again and kept from leaving, especially after one woman told a man about her plans, even if he was drunk, but nothing of the sort happened and they really left it seemed. To still include some violence, we see the injuries on the two women that happened right before the end from this drunk guy. I also thought that maybe they would kill him. By the way, one of the affected there, with less severe injuries, was Hallett's character. That is all then. Overall, I give the outcome a thumbs-down and I am a bit disappointed by the quality here and thought this would be better given all the awards attention it scored. This film really would have needed more subtlety on many occasions or with staying on the road to absolute showiness, it then would have required better writing. You can still take one thing from this film and this is that people who complain about absolutely ridiculous forms of discrimination against females (like gender-appropriate language), might want to come to the conclusion what actual discrimination looks like when seeing this film. I doubt though this is what Polley, McDormand and the rest had in mind, so I cannot count it in their favor. Oh and the guys maybe learn that in this community it is more respectable for a man to be a farmer than to be a teacher. That is all. Go skip the watch here. Not recommended, even if it is admittedly not as bad as ""She Said"", the other major female-empowering film from 2022.",4/10
Women Talking (2022),"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free thoughts, please follow my blog to read my full review :)""Women Talking holds a lovely score by Hildur Guðnadóttir and features truly mesmerizing performances - Claire Foy being a clear standout - with emotionally powerful monologues that can break even the least sensitive viewer.Sarah Polley's exceptionally written and choreographed screenplay tremendously enriches the primary debate driven by the fully developed characters, where trauma, religion, acceptance, forgiveness, revenge, and power are some of the most memorable themes. The detail and complexity that go into each character demonstrate remarkable dedication and care.Worthy of several (and inevitable) awards.""Rating: A-",8/10
Women Talking (2022),"Sarah Polley's 'Women Talking' did not work for me. This story of a group of women - all of whom belong to a U. S. religious sect in the 1960's - who are physically and emotionally abused by their menfolk / husbands, seems more like a dispassionate, politically correct lecture, than a dialogue between real people. Real people in pain. And it should not have had that effect. Particularly in these times when the news is filled with detailed descriptions of what real men do to real women.Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, and. Jesse Buckley play three young women who had been drugged and sexually accosted, and who are now part of a 'commission' asked to decide what the community's women's next steps should be. Should they remain in the community and say / do nothing, remain and fight back, or pack up and leave? In making their decision, each of the three young women describes their lives and their reasons for voting as they do. Rooney Mara's character seems the most undecided, willing to see all sides of the argument and taking different positions over the course of the film. Claire Foy is angry and outspoken but I found it difficult to ascribe a preferred next-step to her. Jesse Buckley is the angriest and, at first, the most unwilling to leave her abusive husband, and it is that - her failure to realize how abused she is - that made me care less about her than I should.Two senior women participate in the commission and one, played by Judith Ivey - made the strongest impression on me. She has the wisdom that comes with age and the ability to put it into words. Ben Whishaw as the one man invited to the commission brings a startling honesty to the proceedings; he more than anyone knows the evil men can do.But for me, the film's 'failure' involves the three young women. There is a cold and distanced quality to their recitals. It is as though they are relating a film they saw, a book they read, rather than expressing the anger, the anxiety, the fear they all know very well.I should have been moved. I should have been angered. I should have been relieved. But I was not.",6/10
Women Talking (2022),"No pun intended - and the inner cynic in me has to be kept down. I understand if some feel differently and I do understand that coping through jokes is the way to go for you. But the subject matter at hand is too serious for me to go that route. One can still make a fun remark (like my summary headline), but overall the real story behind this movie ... horrific to say the least.And while the movie does take quite a few liberties in telling the real story - it also can be seen as what society looked like ... and unfortunately still has not moved on as much from this as it should. I am mincing my words just to be sure not to write something that could be viewed as too offensive. Because while the movie has only the best intentions in mind, writing about what happened to the women, can be considered as ... well people can be triggered by it.The good thing is: it is only talked about. The movie never shows us ... the horrible things. We do get to see some of the aftermath though. That is more than enough - visually speaking. Even if we didn't have it, we would know how despicable and just downright evil it is. So women talking - to decide their fate. Their own fate - something not too easy considering all the things they have to think about. Not only about themselves but about everyone whom that decision will impact.Acting wise this is as good as it gets. The dialog is fresh - considering it only has one location (if you really think about it) to really play out (no pun intended) and show us what is up ... and what is going to happen. Crazy, yet quite powerful ... do not feel ashamed to show your emotions when you watch it - and if you consider this a pun, you may have a cynic bloodline too.",9/10
Women Talking (2022),"The writing/dialogue and acting are absolutely brilliant! A film about a colony of women that converse about fleeing, fighting back a rapist and pros and cons of various aspects which stays interesting throughout. I didn't know about the novel but damn Women Talking is astonishing for its incredible emotions, genuine vibes of authenticness, outstanding directing by Sarah Polley, and everyone involved did a great job; my only complaint is the amount of hate towards men which I'm sure others will agree even that is bearable and well done. I highly recommend Women Talking despite anything about it its all worth it.",9/10
Women Talking (2022),"My Review-
Women Talking
My Rating - 9/10The most interesting and effective aspect of this film for me is that Sarah Polley achieves in telling an incredibly disturbing story of sexual violence with such sensitivity without depicting the violence itself .I think it's because apart from Ben Whishaw who plays August a gentle trusted male teacher the entire cast of characters are women .Women who gather to support each other to debate and decide what action they will take to protect themselves and their children.After seeing the movie based on true events and reading the true account of the vile crimes perpetrated by the men of an isolated pacifist religious community to over 100 women I applaud Sarah Polley and Miriam Toews the screenplay writers who have bought this story to the screen.The novel the movie is based on Women Talking was written by Miriam Toews and was inspired by real-life events that occurred at an isolated Manitoba Mennonite community in Colony in Bolivia.The location is never mentioned and the pacifist Mennonite community is not named .There are many wonderful performances in this movie starring Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, Jessie Buckley , Judith Ivey ,Frances McDormand and Ben Whishaw as August the teacher of the community.The women in this film form a true ensemble cast so all the characters are interesting and complex there's no star turns in this all the women get their share of the drama .Ben Whishaw the only male oddly is the gentlest character in the movie and apparently August his character was the narrator of the original novel .August writes the minutes of this desperate meeting of this group of women as they can't read or write .The women have gathered to vote on three questions while the male perpetrators of rape are awaiting release from custody when their bail is paid.The men are charged with violent sexual attacks on the female members of the community and that they used an anaesthetic used to subdue cattle to rape women and children then when questioned told their victims it's a figment of female imagination.The three questions for the women to decide are
Do they stay and forgive as their pacifist faith demands
Do they stay and fight or
Do they leave the community and risk not entering the Kingdom of Heaven ?In our so called civilised society it's mind boggling to think a community's religion or faith would prevent these violent acts being reported .That the victims would be so passive about reporting them but domestic violence is rife in our communities and we hear everyday of women being killed by violent men and that many stay in danger relationships because of fear and insecurity.Faith Cults religious male dominated communities where indoctrination and isolation can brainwash its members providing a power base for abuse and violence in the name of some deity are evil and time and time again have proved to be the cause of horrific crimes,
A movie like Women Talking helps expose stories of women who are faced with an unseen male menace that has bought fear into their lives I applaud Sarah Polley for bringing this story to the screen and applaud the entire cast.Congratulations also on being nominated for Best Picture and Best adapted screenplay for 2023 well deserved.",9/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"The triangle of sadness is that space right above the nose and between the eyebrows that can get all bunched up when someone is worried, or angry, or confused. We're told this in the opening moments of ""Triangle of Sadness"" when a male model is asked to relax his during an audition. That model, Carl, played by Harris Dickinson, is dating Yaya (the late Charlbi Dean), a social media influencer, and the first chapter of this film, titled ""Carl and Yaya,"" consists almost entirely of the two of them bickering. Carl is vaguely frustrated by the dynamic in their relationship and feels manipulated by Yaya, but in ways he can never clearly articulate. He thinks they fall too quickly into stereotyped gender norms, but every time Yaya tries to correct the situation, he gets angry and tells her she's not getting the point. Does Carl have a valid beef with Yaya, or is he just being a jerk? Yaya admits that she's manipulative and confesses to feeling contrite about it, but is she really? And in any case, do I care about the not super important tribulations of these vapid people, and do I want to spend two and a half hours watching them?But don't worry. Chapter 2 comes along, and Carl and Yaya's relationship quickly becomes secondary. This part is titled ""The Yacht,"" and puts us on a luxury cruise with Carl and Yaya and a bunch of other people who will reveal themselves to be insufferable representatives of the rich and.....if not famous, then....well.....really, really rich.The big set piece of this chapter is the captain's dinner, presided over by Woody Harrelson, who eats a hamburger and fries while everyone else eats squiggly sea creatures and disturbingly colorless jellies. He'll be glad he made that choice, because the seas get rocky. Things go quickly down the toilet from there. Except for the things that don't make it to the toilet in time. And the things that come up from the toilet in all of their liquid and ghastly detail. Seriously, this section of the movie made me queasy for a whole day afterwards every time I even looked at food.You wouldn't think it could get much worse, but it does. We eventually get to chapter 3, ""The Island,"" which finds a handful of survivors who've escaped an exploding yacht (long story) establishing a new social order until help arrives. This is where the movie kicks into full gear, and we start to understand better everything that came before. This is also where the actress Dolly De Leon emerges almost literally out of nowhere to steal the movie out from under everyone else. She plays Abigail, ""toilet manager"" on the cruise, but now queen bee, because she's the only one who has any practical skills. She can catch fish with her bare hands, make fires, cook. What happens when the social order is entirely upended? Abigail gives us a glimpse. What good are your Rolex watches when the most desired commodity becomes a bag of pretzel sticks? As Abigail establishes herself as matriarchal leader of this ragtag civilization, all of those navel gazing conversations about gender roles that Carl and Yaya were having way back at the beginning start to have more meaning, and their fraught relationship directly affects the direction things take.This is all capped off by one of those ambiguous endings that some people will love and that will send others across the internet into a froth of rage.""Triangle of Sadness"" is not especially profound satire. It doesn't have anything to say about rich people that a million other movies haven't already said, and what it does say it says obviously and heavy handedly. But give me any movie about privileged, entitled people being made aware of their helplessness and I'm on board. And this film is right on the nose about what happens when the lower classes get a taste of the power they wield. I mean, during the pandemic, when people in service jobs couldn't work or decided not to, we saw a whole population of affluent Americans lose their minds at the thought of not having enough toilet paper. Just imagine if there had been a shortage of pretzel sticks.This is a fiendishly entertaining movie and makes up in gumption what it lacks in subtlety.Grade: A.",9/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"This is something else and then some!I accidentally stumbled into this movie and I can tell you that his story fascinated me from the very start! Without anything in particular dramatic happening at all, a FASCINATING tension / intrigue was slowly building up inside this story. THAT's the trademark of a brilliant writer and director!This is definitely a director's gem!This director manages to evoke feelings, evoke thoughts, with mere images and without any logical explanation. It is such a joy to watch this mindbending story unfold!The photography needs special mentioning, because it was like a fly on the wall. Subtle, but suggestive. Mysterious and mesmirizing. I was drawn in like rarely happens. I was mesmirized!However great the buildup in eery tension was during the first part of this movie, the final segment of this story was a bit of a let down, because the eery tension was gone. Still fascinating to watch the final unfold and there will surely be a LOT of moral analysis WHAT this picture is all about. But in the end this is what I simply would like to call BRILLIANT CINEMA.BRAVO!Thank you for reading my 1800th review on Imdb!",8/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"This is why I used to go to theaters - to watch thought provoking entertaining movies. While there may be little to no blood - this movie is brutal. No stone is left unturned as you move through society's expectations of class, money and sexual politics. This is not light breezy fun and is sure to turn your stomach just watching it at times. This is a return to an original script not based on some comic book or sequel of some long drawn out franchise. I mean you could watch another DC/Marvel movie but is there a point to that anymore? This is in my humble opinion the best movie of 2022 (so far).",9/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"Triangle of Sadness has received much critical acclaim and comes around with a plot that sounds interesting on paper. The truth is however that this movie is vapid, pretentious and exhausting drivel that doesn't deserve the attention it's getting. Let me point out how I have come to this conclusion.First of all, the movie exaggeratedly tries to criticize contemporary society. The world of modeling is fake and superficial. Influencers are self-consumed and shallow. The rich and famous are greedy and soulless. The poor are jealous and vengeful. This movie brings up so many tired old stereotypes that it doesn't become a satire of contemporary society but rather a satire of its very own kind: pretentiously moralizing films attempting to please trendy prejudices.Up next, this film is unbearably long and clocks in at two and a half hours. We are witnessing models doing a casting for ten minutes. We are watching a toxic couple arguing over financial matters for twenty minutes. We are introduced to a whole range of characters on a yacht for forty-five minutes. Depth there is none. Development there is none. Entertainment there is none.The characters are meant to be antipathic. However, they are never fleshed out and remain dreadfully shallow to a point that viewers will simply not care about their fates at all. Their actions, discussions and motivations keep repeating themselves endlessly. Few movies have ever had so many redundant dialogues as this one.The acting performances also remain mostly shallow. A positive exception is Dolly de Leon who shines as manipulative antagonist in the last third of the movie but is nowhere to be seen before. Harris Dickinson disappoints as protagonist since he doesn't have any charisma whatsoever. His looks are boring, his facial expressions are repetitive and his delivery is redundant. That isn't anything new however since he already couldn't convince in previous features such as The King's Man and See How They Run. Lead actress Charlbi Dean tragically died much too young. If we strictly talk about her acting skills however, she also doesn't have the charisma to carry this movie. She often overacts in an artificial way which becomes nerve-firing through two and a half hours. She never becomes one with her role and instead establishes a distance to it that makes it obvious that she is acting. Talented actresses and actors on the other side are underused in this movie. Woody Harrelson is limited to the role of a drunk captain who keeps yelling nonsense through a closed cabin door time and again. Iris Berben is limited to repeating the same seven words over and over again since she is playing a character that suffered from a stroke and can't express herself very well. The casting choices for this movie have been absolutely dreadful in my opinion.At the end of the day, I would highly recommend you to avoid watching Triangle of Sadness. This movie doesn't live up to its exaggeratedly positive reception. This film doesn't even know what it wants to be: adventure film, black comedy, survival drama, contemporary satire, you name it. Ultimately, this film is nothing but bloated, pretentious and shallow. Even its concept offers nothing new. You would be much better off reading Lord of the Flies or even Robinson Crusoe if you are interested in an analysis of society in a context of isolation. If you absolutely want to watch a contemporary movie with a similar concept, go for Chinese production The Island. The movie is good to very good but compared to the disasterpiece Triangle of Sadness, it almost feels like watching a masterpiece.",2/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"Set in 3 parts, it's a movie about despicable, unlikeable people, some rich, some not, in a 'Lord of the Flies' type situation.It doesn't have a real ending, so it's not a narrative telling of a story.So what's the message? Arms dealers are bad? Duh.A cleaner has more social value than an Instagram influencer? Double Duh.The running time is two and a half hours. Why? It would be easy to get the same message across with an hours less run time.So what makes it worth watching? Well, some of the segments are quite intriguing but none of them give you a pay off.In the end it's message is all you are left with, and it's a pretty stupidly simple one.",4/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"I kept seeing rave reviews coming out of Fantastic Fest 2022 for 'Triangle of Sadness' and it has been on my radar ever since. I saw it was slightly on the longer side in terms of run times so it took me a little while to find the time to watch it. I'm so glad I did though. This is one of the best films I've seen all year.I mentioned that the film was long, however I didn't want it to end. I find a lot of these drawn out 150+ minute films drag and I'm constantly checking my watch. Here though, I would've happily sat through another 3 segments of film with these characters.The film is wickedly smart. It's not out to be subtle with its social messages, but I think that's why it works so well. It's so forthright with them that they can't be taken too seriously. I never felt like the film was trying to preach at me. It was more a case of making fun of generalisations in a hilarious way.Finally, the film is very funny. If you only watch one scene of a movie from 2022 make it the Captain's Dinner from 'Triangle of Sadness'. I haven't laughed that hard in a long time. This film was very, very good. 9.5/10.",9/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"Triangle of Sadness (or Sans Filtre) is most likely the best film Ruben Östlund has ever made. I say ""most likely"" because I'm actually a bit behind on this director, having only seen The Square when I was analyzing its screenplay for my degree project in 2019, ergo I couldn't take in its twisted satire or defiant imagery the way I would've liked.Now, the Swedish legend takes his signature vibe -- pungent uneasiness that soon transitions into abject chaos -- out to sea. And let me tell you, if Titanic had involved a thundering storm instead of an iceberg and if instead of two young lovers trading sweet clichés we got copious cavalcades of sh-t and vomit, I'd get the hype a lot more.A multinational production, the cast is rich and hails from all over the world. We first join two models, Carl (Harris Dickinson) and his more successful influencer girlfriend Yaya (the late Charlbi Dean), working in the modern fashion industry -- which is realistically depicted but subtly-yet-bitingly satirical like only Östlund knows how (here taking a few jabs at performative equality; companies boasting the DEI of their models who are all shaped about the same).As they're invited to a luxury superyacht cruise along what seems to be the East African coast, we meet a multitude of other characters, including Woody Harrelson as the drunken ship's captain, Vicki Bergen as the head of staff, Dolly De Leon as a Filipino cleaning lady who becomes important later, and Zlatko Buric as a Russian oligarch. Between this and 2012, I conclude that ""boisterous Russian billionaire"" was simply the role Buric was born to play.For me (and my fellow Swedish viewers, no doubt), it was especially fun to see revue legend Henrik Dorsin as a lonesome Swedish millionaire. He just has a perfect face and demeanor for comedy -- even the very first shot of him as a dejected, pudgy middle-aged man sitting by himself made me and my theater company laugh.The main attraction in Triangle of Sadness is of course the Captain's Dinner scene, and even if you don't know what's about to happen, you'll suspect it from the start. The film builds it up perfectly; from the subtle tilt of the actors and props, showing the constant (and slowly increasing) instability of the yacht as the seas grow rougher, to the more and more noticeable ways in which the expressions and body language show onsetting nausea, everything flawlessly rises to when Hell at Sea is finally unleashed and all the pratfalls, emeses, and even diarrhea are so convincing I almost believed Östlund must have force-fed his crew ipecac and laxatives.Of course, on top of being a grade-A example of escalatingly chaotic cringe comedy, its setting and characters allow plentiful commentary about billionaires, the industries that get them rich, and the very system that allows some human beings to have that much more than others in the first place. Even during the big ""barfing section"", these ideas appear -- more explicitly than ever, in fact. (The captain and the oligarch, being the only two who don't get seasick, stay behind in the dining hall to get piss-drunk and trade anti-capitalist vs. Anti-communist arguments, quotes, and platitudes, which they then start belting out over the intercom as they become friends and lock themselves inside the captain's office -- whilst the still panic-stricken passengers and crew are forced to listen as they soak in vomit and overflowing septic water.)By circumstances I won't reveal (though I will say that they involve one of the most beautifully poetic and f-cked-up instances of ""Hoist by His Own Petard"" I have ever seen), a few of the characters wind up on a deserted island where all notions of social/class hierarchy have ceased to apply. This section of the film will be even more satisfying to some viewers (particularly those of a socialist persuasion), as the rich are robbed of their abundance and must subsist on base needs like everyone else.But there is yet another layer: stripped of all their belongings, convinced that everyone is now equal and can distribute their resources in terms of need, the tiny society they form soon evolves to a point whereby it starts to resemble a prototype of the very system it sought to destroy. What this implies, I leave for you to decide.The final shot of the film also invites much speculation. Where is our hero running? We can tell -- through basic cinematic language, as my companion pointed out -- that he must be pursuing the characters we saw leave earlier (he's running from the left side of the screen to the right, just as we see the others do throughout their hike) but what has happened? Does he know what the others discovered? Did that one character do what she appeared to be doing to the other character once they reached their goal, and if so, is our hero running because he fears the worst or because he was in on the plot? Or can it be so simple that he has been alerted of the salvation that awaits?Triangle of Sadness is outstanding. My only complaints are minor, including a few character moments that don't make sense -- and can't really be explained away by in-text stupidity -- as well as exactly one CGI donkey that doesn't look great. Still, this is the best time I've had in a movie theater in a long time, as is so often the case when the attendees are offered puke bags and at least one viewer is forced to leave the auditorium for some air.At the screening I attended (and likely all other screenings in my country), the film was preceded by a short snippet of Östlund showing off the Palme D'Or he received at Cannes in May, where he also garnered a standing ovation of eight minutes. Normally, I'd find that sort of thing a tad pretentious, but Östlund seems like a genuine man and, Hell, when it's a filmmaker from my country, I can't help but develop a sports-team mentality of sorts. Suck on that, Denmark. (I kid, I thought the Riget: Exodus was also really good.)",9/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"Look, I get why people are giving high ratings for this movie. It's a satire and has a strong message and whatnot. But the thing is, it can be done with much less screen time. You don't have to drag it out for more than 2 hours. There's so many useless scenes in this movie. I kept fast forwarding while watching, yet I still get the gist of it. And while it's interesting to see how the social ladder gets turned upside down, it's not interesting seeing dragged for so long. It gets boring and dull. Plus there wasn't any admirable character in this movie that the audience would want to root for. They're all just lowlifes. I don't know about you, but I don't enjoy watching immoral people doing the dirty. So for me, this movie is a big NOPE. For you who enjoy this kind of stuff, good for you. Enjoy it. I'd rather find something with more morality in it. Cause this world is already bleak without more bleak messages like this one. I'd rather not see more of these.",5/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"Got a tip from my buddy that this is brilliant and perhaps the best movie of this year. Well, I don't have the same taste.I get that this is critique aimed towards the shallow and useless world of modern society where the wealthy can do what ever they want just because they have money. Being greedy all and all and the server cast who exist just to please them.It is probably the intention to leave up to the viewer to decide if character is being serious, unintentionally funny or absurdly self-deprecating. Unfortunately once you realize the style, all scenes become predictable to the point of just being boring.",4/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"This is one of those movies that you watch, and want to watch because of all the acclaim it received, but in the meantime check the clock all the time to see how many minutes more to go. It is one of those movies where I wonder what I don't see what is so obvious to others. It is like being in a modern art museum and watching this huge painting which is just a white surface with one red and blue line running over it. It eludes me what people see in it and I always suspect the maker to be hiding behind some column laughing at all of us. The emperors clothes.As for the story, the first part begins with a very boring fashion contest, then there is this couple bickering about who will pay the bill for the restaurant. Then we are on a luxury yacht with rich people amusing themselves and later getting into trouble in bad weather. I failed to see anything funny. And finally some of the rich passengers and a cleaning lady are on an island where the cleaning lady is the only one with skills to survive catching fish and making a fire. She requires some intimate services from the man of the couple. And that's it. What am I missing?",4/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"Having adored Ruben's first film and admired his second, I had high hopes for Triangle of Sadness.Unfortunately, whilst there were some strong moments (mostly in the trailer) and I enjoyed many of the performances, it felt overly long and rather self-satisfied.Lampooning the lives of the hyper rich, the ugliness, the greed, should come from a place of neutrality and I feel, MUCH more challenging and nuanced than this rather basic farce full of cheap stereotypes.At no point did I feel that Ruben and the writers felt for a second that they were also part of an elite, as a creation of a privileged bunch of Western European creatives, I'm surprised there's been not much to question this.Was there any introspection as to the hypocrisy of their position? The cinematic equivalent of a western teenager wearing a Che Guevara t-shirt to their private school.Not surprisingly the disconnected Cannes audience ate it up. Awarding it, celebrating it and then popping back to their yachts in the harbour to demand cold champagne and hot massages from ""the staff"".",4/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"I dislike this film. It's boring and random and one of the few films where I, personally, thought that the acting was stale. The overall movie is so much about ""delivering the message"" that plot nosedives and ends up becoming bland.The story is not predictable, in a bad way. Just when you think that something interesting might take place or that an intriguing mystery will get revealed, the plot continues to move straightforward with the most obvious decisions. There's no subtleness nor any metaphors, this movie could've been shown as historical fiction docu-drama and I would've believed it cause the actual script reads like an edgy guy who just saw a couple of videos on different economical theories and decided to become Marxist or Socialist.And the characters are shallow (which I guess was the point) and have almost no character development. Additionally, the actors themselves are just not feeling into it (especially the lead actors that play Carl and Yaya).And the ending wasn't good too. Again, as I stated in the title, too on the nose and too hellbent on pushing the same message down the throat of the audiences, who I'm pretty sure will have gotten it by end of act 2.Overall, don't know how or why this film is generating Oscar buzz, it certainly felt nowhere close to it. It's pretentious to its core and exhibits no sense of either fun or maturity, If you want to see a film that actually delivers this same message tastefully and with more fun, skip this and watch The Menu.3 stars for a couple of chuckles here and there.Not recommended.",3/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"There has been a lot of buzz about Triangle of Sadness, especially given that it won the prestigious Palm D'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Generally, however, reviews have been divided, with some calling it a hilarious anti-rich romp, and some criticizing it for being shallow in its satire.But the problem with Triangle of Sadness has nothing to do with whether or not it is good dark comedy. The problem is that it's a complete mess. Annoying, disjointed, and appallingly slow, this is one of the most unpleasant cinemagoing experiences I've had all year. However, I can't deny that it is very well-made and acted, which saves the movie from outright badness.The film starts off on the wrong foot with a long, long argument between its two protagonists. It's clearly supposed to show how shallow rich people are, but the scene should be around two minutes and instead takes up what feels like twenty. Both characters are intensely irritating: again, not on its own an issue, but it's not justified sufficiently to make it worthwhile.Initially, you think to yourself ""no matter. A lot of movies don't start great. This is bound to get better."" But, unfortunately, the opposite is true. Triangle of Sadness doesn't just have an overly long and slow beginning section, it's an overly long and slow movie. You find out that it scarcely has anything that resembles a plot or any real structure, and almost every single one of the characters are designed to be extremely unlikable. This leads to scene after scene of no consequence and little entertainment value, interspersed with only the occasional mildly amusing gag. Any through line established in the opening is completely dropped for no apparent reason. Even when the boat is finally left behind, the plot does not pick up whatsoever and still refuses to engage the audience.What's most frustrating is that the elements for a great movie are right there. The acting is executed well and the movie is styled in a unique yet restrained way. Some of the humour even elicits laughs, a rare trait for a modern comedy. But none of this is enough to fully salvage the film and make it worth watching. Triangle of Sadness is a movie that has the trappings of great cinema, but it's all in service of a wretched, vacuous hole at its center.Finally Score: 46/100.",5/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"The first thing I want to say is, all of the pretentious explanations of why this film was good, are down to the fact that some people have to see the good in bad, to prove their higher worth and higher appreciation of art.The truth is that this film is a rubbish film with rubbish scenes, rubbish acting and rubbish dialogue. There's very silly parts which simply don't make sense. There's other parts I can't remember because my mind tuned out of it frequently as it was so boring and annoying.

Triangle of Sadness (2022),"This mess is a result of being on a bad acid trip when writing the screenplay, then drunker than Woody Harrelson's (the only reason I gave this a watch) character when directing. All the high praise and positive reviews are probably the result of those viewers being under the same influence of bad recreational pharmaceuticals and cheap liquor.Writer, director and editor (was this mess even edited ?) Ruben Ostlund has no clue on satirical delivery, nor how to tell a story. This film needs to be an example in film school on what not to do. The ridiculously long and poorly paced 2-1/2 hour runtime was about 2 hours too long. This felt more like a last minute bad SNL sketch dragged out to eternity.Ostlund tried to create something deep and smart but in reality, it is an arrogant display of cartoonish, lazy, basic hollow writing. There's a huge lack of follow-through. Satires should at least make you laugh - this one maybe one chuckle in 147 mins of torture. His use of chapters was bloated, skewered, skattershotly uneven and superficial nonsense, with about 20 minutes of ridiculous verbal diarrhea masking itself as social commentary being spewed out over a ship's intercom. This film is neither as smart nor as interesting as it clearly thinks it is.This is the worst directed and written film I've seen in a long time. If you want to get even at someone, have them watch this mess telling them to be patient until the end for the big welcoming and worth-the-wait reveal. You'll never hear from them again. It's a very generous 3/10 from me, all for the casting and performances considering what they had to work with, and the cool We've Lost Dancing ending song.",3/10

Till we get on the ship we get bored to death with a lot of mostly useless and unnecessary scenes after scenes.

Triangle of Sadness (2022),After watching the trailer I was so excited about downloading and watching this dark comedy which I proceeded and did. It's starts off great with the scene of the male models being interviewed and then young couples dialog over who pays for the dinner at the restaurant and then the story jumped to the story of the passengers on the yacht with Woody as their captain. But after they are shipwrecked (no spoilers on the how and why) the story takes a serious nose dive and starts falling completely apart in the process. The build up to the ending scene was totally nonsensical and you realize that the trailer has the best parts for entire film. A underwhelmingly recommended one time watch. Heads up.... Woody Harrelson's role is short and brief.,3/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"I really like the Square so I was expecting Triangle of Sadness to be similarly brilliant take on wealth. Didn't quite get what I expected.Triangle of Sadness never really finds its own voice as it first introduces a lot of oblivious characters, who all come across as thin stereotypes we have seen many times over in countless movies, and then puts them into situations that are what you'd expect them to get into. There is the dumb and jealous male model and his flirtatious girlfriend. There is the rich and loud Russian. There is the drunk captain. There is the prim head of ship staff. There is the lovely British couple who got rich selling grenades.Making matters worse, there isn't much plot which Director Östlund tries to make up by stretching each scene to extreme lengths. The epitome of this approach is the seasickness interlude that had everyone throwing up for over 10 minute. None of it matters, just like the characters don't matter.After what feels like an eternity, the story drifts to a dead end that is lifted straight from an old Amanda Bynes comedy. At least that poor teenage vehicle knew how to tie its own loose ends whereas Östlund abruptly abandons his characters as if having got enough of everyone.",4/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"Classism, capitalism, materialism and wealth are all on the chopping block in ""Triangle Of Sadness,"" writer/director Ruben Östlund's spiritual follow-up to his 2017, Golden-Palm-winning satire ""The Square."" Satires are usually either a hit or a miss for me. Whether I understand the message is not really where things all break down for me either. Instead, it's the communication of the message - the execution - that can make or break a satire for me. Am I lectured to? Talked down to? Beaten over the head? With ""Triangle Of Sadness,"" Östlund nails that sweet spot of delivering a nuanced message in a satisfying manner, with inarguable entertainment value and great performance work throughout. This piece covers so much ground - narratively, logistically, as well as thematically. It's really quite impressive work. I think the best thing I can say about a satire is that, when things round out, you really get a clear sense of the filmmaker's take on the subject matter at hand. I think ""Triangle Of Sadness"" earns that acclamation in spades.",9/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"Unfortunately I had high expectations for this film, which makes it all the more painful to have to write this review. It was unfortunate to watch a film in which the targets, a group of the elite, could have been attacked in such a more effective and witter fashion. Instead you have some pretty cheap slapstick, gross-out humoured attempts at comedy which is overdone. If you were expecting any witty dialogue then forget it. The audience will get the obvious symbolism littered carelessly throughout the film, but apart from that it comes across as a very formulaic, falling pretty flat in the kinds of mechanisms it employs. The latter third of Triangle of Sadness becomes completely predictable and doesn't really come across as satirical comedy. It seems to bafflingly mark a transition away from satire to more of a castaway sort of situation that appears to be a trashy postmodern recreation of the old film, ""The Admirable Crichton."" The exception is that it lacks any depth and could've been so much better, even when it does try desperately hard to come across as furnishing the audience with deep political or philosophical themes. Was it supposed to be funny, a progressive feminist take or sophisticated subversive turn in watching one of the wealthy characters become manipulated into having sex with one of the workers in a wholly predictable ""exploited turned exploiter"" character role reversal? In short, it is a postmodern farce that lacks any real substance and far too heavily on style - appearing to be more prosaic than it actually is.",3/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"The winner of the 2022 Cannes Film Festival's coveted Palme d'Or prize, Ruben Östlund's Oscar nominated latest slice of melancholy and home truths about the human condition is going to be a divisive exercise for audiences as the Swedish director examines the divide between the haves and the have nots in an epic darkly comedic operation that will likely ensure it's sometime between trips to your local seafood market.Flirting the line between dramatic beats and Monty Python like physical comedy and outlandish situations, Östlund's Triangle of Sadness is broken up into multiple chapters, with the central figures to the story being Harris Dickinson's down on his luck model Carl and his influencer girlfriend Yaya (played by the late Charlbi Dean who sadly passed away not long after the films release) as the two find themselves aboard a luxury yacht captained by Woody Harrelson's unpredictable literature loving overseer who is going to provide the cruise's guests with numerous unforgettable memories.In no hurry across its questionably extensive two and half hour runtime, many will not be able to predict where Sadness is going as it slowly and surely wanders along its narrative that around the midway point provides viewers with some of the most unexpected and eye-popping cinematic moments of recent memories as Östlund's razor sharp social commentary takes hold and the journey of Carl, Yaya and the cruise's many guests and staff crash headfirst in an explosive way, leading to various revelations and contemplation's for the films colourful characters.Headlined well by rising star Dickinson and the taken too soon Dean, who you sense was destined for big things following this effort, Sadness finds some fantastic moments courtesy of Östlund's award worthy screenplay and some fantastic turns from the likes of Dolly De Leon as softly spoken ship handmaid Abigail, Zlatko Buric as Russian millionaire Dimitry (stealing the films best scene courtesy of a P. A system) and the always enjoyable Harrelson, who as per usual makes the most of any screen time he has given as a man who appears to have had enough of playing along with mandatory niceties.With so much to enjoy and unpack across Sadness's extensive runtime, there is a strong sense that Östlund's feature runs out of steam in the latter stages and while it's best that viewers head into Sadness as blind as possible, once the films last chapter takes hold there are less wins for the narrative as we begin to look forward to a neat wrap up that comes in the form of one of the more abrupt endings of 2022, one that is likely to cause significant debate amongst the film community, much like the film as a whole that some will adore and others loathe.Final Say -Providing us with some of the more memorable genuinely hilarious moments of any film from the last 12 months, Triangle of Sadness is a unique feature film from one of the most individual voices in world cinema and while the film does run out of steam in its endgame, Östlund's film is still another fine addition to an increasingly impressive resume of releases.4 hand grenades out of 5.Jordan and Eddie (The Movie Guys)",8/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"Ten days after its opening here in Denmark, this movie is still playing to packed theatres, so apparently many people like it. It also has a pretty high rating, but I fear it will go down.I am an anti-capitalist myself, so I appreciated what this movie was trying to do, which is to use ham-fisted symbolism to problematize and criticize capitalism. There were some good scenes, mainly during the captain's dinner scene, but unfortunately I just don't think Östlund is much of an accomplished writer or director. Throughout this movie I was bored - esp. By the slowness, which is really unforgivable. Very little really happened in this movie in terms of plot, and it took forever to get to the meatier parts. For a comedy, it also wasn't much fun. 2-3 laughs, tops. Comic timing wasn't good. The political message of the movie was also so heavy-handed that it can hardly be called art; it's more of a didactic tract. At 2 hours and 30 minutes, the movie is far, far, faaar too long - an entire hour could easily be cut.The length is a particular sin because of the movie's infuriatingly terrible ending, which is sudden and nonsensical, making the audience feel like we've only gotten half of the story. That ending, which cut off the plot, leaving it unresolved, cost this movie a whole star in my rating. Endings are hard, granted - but this is the ending of a writer/director who really doesn't know how to structure a story. As a result, the movie only gets a slightly above average rating - 6 stars out of 10 - from me. A disappointment.",6/10
Triangle of Sadness (2022),"The good news. Woody harrelson is only in one third of the film. The odd news. Seventy percent of the reviewers give this movie an 8 or higher. The bad news. This thing stinks. A millennial argues over who should pay the check and why. They they get on a yacht and continue to argue. The young man is especially annoying. Just how spoiled can you get. Then we meet some of the paying guests on the yacht. Arms dealers, marxists, commies, etc. The theme of the crew-keep the passengers happy. Yes to everything. No matter how stupid the request or question. (remember we're supposed to be laughing during all this). Rough seas dampen dinner with the drunken captain and the hilarity starts. If watching people throw up and get tossed around the ship is your cup of tea, this part is for you. There's more going on, but trust me, its not pleasant. Then a drunken passenger takes over the pa system and announces the ship is going down and then explains that its a joke. Watching a husband get his stricken wife into a wheel chair is a laugh riot. Ha, ha. We don't see what happens next. Hijackers take over the ship and in fact it does sink. Then we get into a little of lord of the flies and maybe gilligan's island. There's comeuppance for those who don't get it? (are movie audiences dumber now because of covid and watching tv for two years)? Apparently the film maker thinks so.. the trailer gave me pause. I should have listened to my little voice. Stinker, stinker. Or maybe it was sinker.",1/10

Triangle of Sadness (2022),"Palme D'or winner at Cannes this year from Ruben Östlund.I surely didn't know what to expect.Because this was something really absurd and wild.Absolutely hilarious satire about rich peoples.No boring points at all.So interesting and somehow really unique story split in three quite different parts.First one is like intro to two main characters and comedy was more subtle.Second one definitely was the craziest one that made me laugh hysterically so many times.Third chapter did continue do that same with also bringing more character study in story.So interesting to see how power dynamics are changing constantly in this film.Overall this film had so many great characters with unique personalities.Nobody is that likable at all, but that definitely is the point.Great performances from everyone.Not that many bigger actors other than Woody Harrelson who was fantastic.So sharp comedy.This film was so wild ride.Absolutely amazing.",10/10
We Have a Ghost (2023),"Set in a house in the Chicago area, one year after the previously family fled without explanation, the house is now occupied by the Presley family consisting of father Frank (Anthony Mackie), mother Melanie ""Mel"" (Erica Ash), and Fulton (Niles Fitch) and Kevin (Jahi Winston) the older and younger sons respectively. Kevin is none too thrilled at the prospect of having moved yet again as Frank has made a habit of going for ill-advised business ventures that necessitate their moving from place to place. While exploring the attic Kevin encounters a ghost of a man in a bowling shirt with the name ""Ernest"" (David Harbour) stitched on the breast who tries in vain to scare Kevin who records the apparition on his phone. As Kevin tries to communicate with Ernest in the hopes of getting to know him better, the two strike up a friendship. However Kevin's brother and father soon find the video on his phone and posting the video on the internet turns Ernest into a social media sensation much to Kevin's annoyance. As Ernest can't remember anything from when he was alive, Kevin works with his next door neighbor Joy Yoshino (Isabella Russo) to track down clues to Ernest's identity as Dr. Leslie Monroe (Tig Notaro), an agent of the CIA paranormal program ""Wizard Clip"" attempts to get Ernest into CIA custody.We Have a Ghost is the latest film from writer director Christopher Landon who had previously made a name for himself with the two Happy Death Day films as well as the body switch slasher Freaky. Based on the short story Ernest by Geoff Manaugh, Landon taps into more high concept territory as he takes the familiar premise of comic haunted house movies (such as 95's Casper and especially Burton's Beetlejuice) and puts his own spin on it for the modern age. Like Landon's previous efforts, he takes a well trodden formula and makes it feel fresh thanks to a smart script, strong direction, and good performances from the ensemble.At the center of the film is undeniably David Harbour as the titular ghost and it's a fantastic performance from Harbour in spite of the fact he can't speak. Harbour was hesitant to take on the role as it would be challenging to create a compelling character without words, but Harbour shows just how versatile and charismatic of a presence he is not only scoring big laughs from his physicality and the pantomime nature of his performance, but also eliciting some strong emotional resonance and a sense of sadness and tragedy that makes you really care about him. Outside of Harbour, the movie is supported by a terrific ensemble. Jahi Winston is very good as the co-lead and he makes a solid audience proxy whom we enjoy seeing go through the supernatural shenanigans. Winston does a good job of making his interactions with Ernest and his neighbor and love interest Joy played by Isabella Russo very endearing and when the three of them are together in the movie they play off nicely against each other. Anthony Mackie, Erica Ash, and Niles Fitch get some good mileage playing Kevin's family and their varying reactions to how the ghost affects their lives with Frank booking TV appearances, Fulton using it for popularity and Mel at her wits end with the crowds of Ernest fans and TikTokers camped outside their house leads to some fantastic comic set pieces. Tig Notaro is also very good as Dr. Leslie Monroe who serves as our primary antagonist and serves as a more nuanced take on the role Walter Peck played in Ghostbusters. Tig brings a lot of humanity to the role and does well playing a driven and quirky CIA agent.At it's core the movie is essentially a mash-up of Beetlejuice by way of Starman or E. T. (particularly in the second half). While the stuff around centered around the house is very good with the satire of internet fame and haunted house trappings, Landon takes the action on the road in a creative way as Kevin, Joy and Ernest search for more clues to Ernest's identity and we get some really creative and humorous sequences that often had me giving solid belly laughs. We Have a Ghost runs strongly for a good 75% of the runtime, but around the last 25% I started to notice some things began to drag. I personally think the movie runs a little long at two hours, and while it does stay funny there is a ""flabbiness"" in the structure that made the comic rhythm stumble a bit. I also felt like the movie had two different ideas of how it wanted to end because they introduce a secondary antagonist towards the end of the second act and it feels like it deviates a bit too far from the established pieces in my opinion and it probably could've been tied up better by having a singular antagonistic force.We Have a Ghost is a strong high concept comedy that features a great comedic performance by Harbour and a likable ensemble strongly directed by Landon. Landon's script remains funny for a good chunk of the running time, but does feel like it loses some integrity around the 90 minute mark and feels like the third act could've done with a bit of tweaking. A solid recommendation especially if you've an affinity for the likes of Beetlejuice, Ghostbusters, or Starman.",7/10
We Have a Ghost (2023),"It seems Netflix are determined to releasing new weekly movies that are mediocre and too long. This easily, just like other Netflix-films like the recent Jason Mamoa films Slumberland and Sweet Girl or the very recent Your place or mine, could have been 90 minutes. I'm confident I would have enjoyed this film much more if it was shorter - now I just feel numb.Sometimes a light comedy can be just what I crave. It can have medium reviews but in a certain mood, a ""medium"" film can be perfect. But for two hours? Landons previous films in the Happy Death Day-franchise + Freaky are much more succesful in being enjoyable.",5/10
We Have a Ghost (2023),"The adventure/comedy film We Have a Ghost, directed by Christopher Landon, is thrilling, captivating and engaging. I like how this film balances elements of comedy and drama, while still maintaining a suspenseful plot.Based on the short story, ""Ernest,"" by Geoff Manaugh, this film follows the Presley family as they embark on a mission to find a new home. The home they hope to make lifelong memories in, is haunted by a ghost named Ernest who quickly comes to be known as nothing other than misunderstood. Since Ernest has no recollection of how or why he died, his soul is unable to fully leave earth. Eventually, the youngest child of the Presley family, Kevin, makes it his life mission to find this out and with that, the family gains fame.My favorite character is most-definitely Ernest (David Harbour). Wonderful performance! Considering that David Harbour had zero previous experience with a character such as Ernest, he portrays the role magnificently. He is able to gain pity from the viewers, which is extremely rare for ghosts in films. Ernest's character development evolves perfectly, allowing viewers to grasp the moments of importance responsible for changing Ernest's perspective on life. It allows us to think of Ernest as a misunderstood, confused and helpless soul rather than an angry and malicious ghost. The spectrum of emotions that Ernest experiences do not feel rushed, but are perfectly timed out and displayed. My favorite aspect of this film is how it differs from previous adventure or horror-based films. In most cases, the threat (Ernest) will not associate with the victims - the Presley Family -- in any way other than causing them harm. However, We Have a Ghost offers a fresh dynamic of friendship and cooperation, allowing viewers to not get stuck in the same thriller film cycle. Instead of expecting certain scenes or character motives to take place, I loved seeing something fresh in this film genre. I commend Director Christopher Landon for incorporating new and unexpected ideas to this film.This film's message is to appreciate, value and love the people in your life. Appreciate the littlest moments, because at any given time, those moments can turn into only memories --live life to the very fullest.I give We Have A Ghost 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. This film releases on Netflix February 24, 2023. Enjoy! By Nathalia J., KIDS FIRST!",10/10
We Have a Ghost (2023),"Honestly, I had some expectations considering I have enjoyed the last few films of this director bur this time Christopher Landon chose to deliver the routine stuff. A family moves into their new house and find it to be a haunted by a ghost. Filming the encounter, they decide to make some quick money by uploading the video on youtube. As they go viral, getting all the attention from the public as well as CIA for a strange reason. It is upto the younger son who forms a bond with Ernest the ghost to free his soul by figuring out what exactly happened to him.I wouldn't say the jokes were pedestrian but the movie was devoid of any twists. It did have couple of likable characters and dialogue-less roaring David Harbour. With a two hours runtime, the film definitely feels long and it being entirely predictable doesn't help. Some scenes do work with the ghost on the run and that's about it. At best it is a one time to kill some time on Netflix but overall the film has very little to offer.",4/10
We Have a Ghost (2023),"This is a good family movie with a ghost mystery in it. I don't understand the low ratings? It was a little long, but all the content was applicable. The dysfunctional family dynamics, budding teenage romance, action & adventures, and a few scary scenes and some emotional, almost tear jerking, moments are all in this movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has teenagers and have parents watch with their kids and discuss the family's situation and how they come together in the end. I really like the actor from ""Stranger Things"" who plays the ghost. He brings so much depth to the character, and the chemistry between the boy and him just works. Give this one a watch!",10/10
We Have a Ghost (2023),"Why is it OK to generalize white people and make them a ""they"" now? It seems embraced in Hollywood to call out race as a punchline or demonize to the point where being prideful of your background is not allowed anymore unless you aren't white.I really love ghost movies, stories, etc and wanted to like this. But it turns into the opposite of a family film when I have to explain why being white is called out to my 6 year old. Besides drawing a person on paper, she has no impression of why skin color would matter, let alone be ok to make fun of. It really bums me out that this is how we are evolving.",3/10
We Have a Ghost (2023),"Look, the movie actually started off alright. I thought it began entertaining, especially with seventies and eighties references to movies and music. It had potential until it started making reference to race. I went into this hoping for a quaint comedy and what I got made me shut it off at 30 minutes. The crazy white families line turned me off. I'll admit it. This movie had potential but it failed in racial identity politics. So I'll pass but give marks for casting and direction. I'm sure the rest of the movie may have been alright but I was unwilling to endure it because I just can't sit and watch a movie that goes out of it's way to insult ANY race. So sorry, for the first five it was ok, after that I have better things to watch. This script sucked, No fault in the actors.",3/10
We Have a Ghost (2023),"We Have a Ghost is a Netflix horror comedy that tries to be too many things at once and fails at most of them. The film is based on a short story by Geoff Manaugh, but it adds unnecessary subplots, characters, and twists that dilute the original premise. The film follows the Presley family, who discover a friendly ghost named Ernest in their new home and become viral sensations. However, they also attract the attention of a shady government agency, a vengeful killer, and a mysterious cult.The film suffers from an uneven tone, shifting from family drama to slapstick comedy to action thriller without any coherence or logic. The characters are poorly developed and act inconsistently throughout. The ghost himself is barely explored, despite being the title character. The film wastes the talents of its cast, especially David Harbour as Ernest, Anthony Mackie as Frank, and Jennifer Coolidge as an eccentric medium.The film does have some funny moments, mostly thanks to Coolidge's antics and Harbour's charm. The visual effects are decent enough for a Netflix production. However, these are not enough to save this film from being a disappointing and forgettable experience.",4/10
We Have a Ghost (2023),"""We have a Ghost"" is a lighthearted and entertaining adventure, similar in tone and theme to Ghostbusters. In normal cirumstances, I'd give this film an 8 stars rating. Bug Tig Notaro's performance is so unprofessional that can't be ignored. It's puzzling that she has been casted not in one but several films. In fact, it seems like a supernatural event no less incredible than the existence of ghosts.Every time Tig Notaro is on screen she becomes distracting, because you're never sure what emotion she's trying to convey. And it seems the director wasn't sure either, because he stays with her longer than he should, probably expecting her to do ""something"". But she just stands there. She doesn't move her body, and she barely moves her face. You could move a mannequin with your hands and it'd look more alive and expressive than Tig Notaro.",4/10
We Have a Ghost (2023),"OK, so I only watched this excessively long ghost story because the trailer promised Jennifer Coolidge in a fright wig of her character's own making. However, she only appears in a blip of a cameo as a psychic fraud. Directed erratically by Christopher Landon, the 2023 movie itself starts as a typical haunted house farce done on a more elaborate scale than Bob Hope could've imagined, but it changes tone considerably when it becomes a morality tale of redemption. Anthony Mackie appears to be inheriting Will Smith's pre-slap, 'family man' roles, and as his sullen teenaged son, Jahi Di'Allo Winston manages to be affecting as the ghost's new best friend. David Harbour creates genuine pathos as the ghost, but the 126-minute running time and redundant apparition scenes wore down my patience.",5/10

We Have a Ghost (2023),"From the well-known writer-director Christopher Landon, who has
showcased films such as Freaky, Disturbia, Happy Death Day 1, Happy Death Day 2, Scouts Guide to Zombie Apocalypse, Viral, and 5 of the Paranormal Activity films under his belt, comes the supernatural thriller We Have a Ghost. He is the son of the infamous actor Michael Landon who became famous in the 70s through early 90s with Tv series such as Little House on the Prarie, Bonanza, and Highway to Heaven.Unlike his earlier films that have more intensity and heightened elements of fear and horror, We Have a Ghost is a much more tapered-down version of his somewhat uniquely unhinged style typical with wistful turns.The story is much similar in spirit to one of the most-known iconic films ""Ghost"", directed by Jerry Zucker and played by Patrick Swayze and Debbie Moore. Although Jerry Zucker's Ghost is a love story, Christopher Landons' We Have a Ghost is a story of young adults who are struggling with their identities in a brutally judgemental harsh social world, that is instantaneously connected to everyone. And such displays the disparity between the parents who were raised in a world that does not exist today and the children who grow much faster and more maturer than their parents did thus, they feel disconnected and do not understand their parents as well as their reasonings. And they are dealing with a silent Ghost in their house in their own ways.It is very well-acted, directed, and written. It may not be everyone's cup of tea because the targeted age group is young adults and it is a film that you can be watch with the entire family.",7/10
We Have a Ghost (2023),"Really, anything with bright colors will keep a child's attention. Unfortunately for the rest of us, there is nothing of any substance.The entire film is formulaic and too closely follows tropes and negative stereotypes, including casual racism, appealing to current far left politics, and the lowest common denominator of social media and media in general.We get a few decent performances from a few decent actors. We get middling performances from middling actors. The acting isn't terrible, so there's that. There is no room in this film, however, for good acting.The film is a ghost mystery with some comedy. I can't say I as much as smiled at any part of the film. As for the mystery, you already know the outcome of not only the mystery, but every beat of the film based solely on the context within each scene.Do you have kids or just trying to turn your brain off after a 16 hour day at work?

Tendency to compare is too prevalent which can ruin any sort of experience. Different story which is unique. Fun emotional ride and a bit nostalgic. Can be watched twice which is hardly a case with movies these days. Kudos to the director for trying something different.",6/10
We Have a Ghost (2023),"From Christopher Landon, the man behind films such as Happy Death Day and Freaky, comes a funny and moving ghost story, with great cast and cool car chases as well. The story follows a family of four who moves into a new house, only to find out that it's haunted by the ghost of a guy (David Harbour) who wears a bowling shirt with the name Ernest on it. The first to come into contact with him, is the younger sensitive son, Kevin (played by Jahi Di'Allo Winston), who feels all alone and can't connect with his family, especially his father (Anthony Mackie). When Kevin sees Ernest, he bonds with him and makes it his mission to find out his story and help him cross over to the other side, but naturally it's not that simple, as the family find themselves targeted by the CIA (Tig Notaro and Steve Coulter), who want to capture Ernest and do experiments on him. Kevin teams up with the girl next door (Isabella Russo) in order to uncover the mystery behind Ernest and help him out. Even though there are so many ghost stories, this one does offer something fun and new, first of all seeing David Harbour playing a ghost (with unattractive hair cut) and not being able to say any words, is truly impressive. The rest of the cast does good job all around (too bad Jennifer Coolidge had such a short time on screen though). I especially loved a moving scene between Kevin and his father, where he becomes honest and tells him that he's proud of him. Also the visuals and soundtrack are also great. The films discusses many topics such as family, social media and the power of friendship (even with a ghost).",6/10

Also tries too hard with jokes that also make your straight face even straighter. The plot moves slow with no story building. Like, who is this family? What makes the son so emo and angry? Why did they buy this house? And even after the movie ended, I still have no idea who are these people. Oh and that part with the neighbour girl with the computer? Absolutely amazing! They did it even better than Disney's Kim Impossible.More than half of the main casts' acting is so so bad, especially the son, Kevin. He cannot convey any emotions, which makes his character unlikable, unrelatable, uninteresting.And last but not least...cringeee.",5/10
We Have a Ghost (2023),"Seriously? Not even really a one time watch at best. Which is shockingly surprising with such a talented cast. The cast did their job, but the movie overall was not awesome. It was not great. It was actually unwatchable.It was not anything I felt to invest more time wasting away in sheer boredom. I don't even think children would be entertained.How is it that with today's ability to craft incredible films that people can't write a decent script with any originality? Just recycle old movies and story lines with a slight twist? Have we not see this same family dynamic 100 times now? You would think people would do better by now.Super disappointing and a complete waste of time. I feel sorry for the actors that got sucked into working on this film because it doesn't showcase how truly talented and amazing they are. This is not even a made for TV, or something you want to watch when you are sick in bed. It will probably make you feel more sick by the lack lustre and generic uncreative mindless recycled material.",1/10
We Have a Ghost (2023),"Jennifer Coolidge made me love the movie! Her appearance is basically what made me laugh all through. It's a relatively nice movie with some underlying morals and an exciting premise. 'Captain America' and 'Hellboy' also deliver a nice performance. Though the writing is a bit subpar, the star-studded cast delivers a stellar performance. Christopher landon also gives a great direction for the entire film. Over and above, I think its an interesting premise with a few good laugh. Id have givrn it a 10 but the writing was not all that. So it deservedly gets an 8/10. The graphics is also quite great. A generally nice movie!",8/10
Somebody I Used to Know (2023),"Greetings again from the darkness. As consistently as January brings horror films, we can count on February to deliver Romantic Comedies released around Valentine's Day. Although, these days, even rom-coms tend to arrive carrying the weight of social messaging wrapped in inclusion, with a concerted effort to avoid ruffling feathers and hurting feelings. The husband and wife writing team of Dave Franco and Alison Brie, with Franco directing and Brie in a lead role, have managed to play by the new rules and still deliver a watchable film - albeit one that I found more sad than comedic.Ally (Alison Brie, THE POST, ""Mad Men"") is a showrunner/producer of a dessert-centric reality TV show. Season three has just wrapped, and Ally has been informed her show will not be renewed. As with any career-minded person, Ally is devastated and heads home to visit her mother and clear her head. The hometown she left a decade ago to chase her dream of being a documentary filmmaker in Los Angeles is the 'always Christmas' town of Leavenworth in Washington state. An awkward intrusion on her mother (Julie Hagerty) sends Ally to the local bar where she bumps into the former flame she dumped to purse those doc dreams.Ally and Sean (Jay Ellis, TOP GUN: MAVERICK, 2022) quickly fall into the comfort zone of a long ago relationship, and spend the night frolicking about the town. Sean does refuse the intimate offer from Ally, which leads her to blindly stumble into his engagement weekend the next day. Yep, it's a detail Sean conveniently forgot to mention during their wild night, and now Ally is face to face with Cassidy (Kiersey Clemons, ANTEBELLUM, 2020) and Sean's entire family. His mother's (Olga Merediz) request for Ally to be the wedding videographer is just the opening Ally needs to begin her battle plan of stopping the wedding.It's at this point where we can't help but think of MY BEST FRIEND'S WEDDING (1997), and the writers take this head-on with a mention. We can't tell if Ally thinks she can win back Sean or if she is merely taking out her frustrations in recognizing what she turned down years ago when she chose career of Sean. The tone begins to shift when Ally sees Cassidy performing with her punk rock band, and as the two women talk to each other, it becomes clear that Ally views Cassidy as a younger version of herself. Cassidy even discloses that her bisexuality caused the estrangement with her closed-minded parents. So how does one undermine the wedding of another who isn't so bad after all?Also involved are Ally's old best friend Benny (Brie's ""Community"" co-star Danny Pudi), who injects some humor and tries to prevent her meddling, and Sean's stepbrother played by Haley Joel Osment, who tosses out a Brendan Fraser reference ... actually kind of funny, especially in comparison to the Jeremy Renner joke that will likely cause mass cringing. Most of the characters are grounded enough that it's a difference from many rom-coms, but we do get the feeling a few times that much effort was put forth in creating something outside the normal tropes, rather than the typical ""aww, how sweet"" moments we are usually subjected to in this genre.Dave Franco is the younger brother of James Franco, and is a frequent actor who previously directed THE RENTAL (2020), one that varies substantially from this one. Alison Brie is best known for her acting roles, but also previously wrote HORSE GIRL (2020) and SPIN ME ROUND (2022). Here, she doesn't shy away from a character that we initially pull for, yet end up kind of annoyed with. It's not a typical break-up movie, or sappy romance, or he/she is 'the one' story. Instead, it draws on mean girl tendencies, jealousies, and regrets ... yet also delivers the message of staying true to one's self. As a compliment, it can be said that the film cannot be lumped in with our usual Valentine's Day saccharine.Opens in theaters on February 10, 2023.",6/10
Somebody I Used to Know (2023),"I like Allison Brie a lot. She is charming in some ways in this Romantic Comedy about a Los Angeles television star who returns home after her show is cancelled and reconnects with her ex-boyfriend. Ted by he problem is that her ex-boyfriend is now engaged and on the verge of getting married, and it gets complicated. Jeremy is played by The Sixth Sense's Haley Joel Osmond, and is very awkward. There are some cute moments. The premise is a little mean, but Brie's lovable personality makes it less so-or does it. The meanest part is how her boyfriend's current girlfriend is inadvertently collateral damage. Many of the lines and relationship are weak. It is low budget. It is predictable . It is awkward-not romantic in my opinion.",4/10
Somebody I Used to Know (2023),"Dave Franco's sophomore directorial has a definite flow and some interestingly grey-shaded protagonists. Where it doesn't stick is in its first act (the whole ""Do I hate my job?"" aspect isn't called out well enough) and the somewhat rushed finale, with everything getting sorted out so easily. The middle section, however, had me completely invested. The writing by Dave and Alison tries hard not to succumb to some derivative tropes of the steal-your-guy genre but it ends up doing just that. That said, the film does offer some moments of shine as the leads are well-written and performed, and even some of the supporting cast (featuring the likes of Danny Pudi and Julie Hagerty) adds on. To brand this film an all-out romantic comedy isn't exactly correct - it's more of a romantic drama with bits of organic humour added unevenly.",5/10
Somebody I Used to Know (2023),"This one's really weird with a pretty predictable storyline. I think this is the first movie where the wronged party (the fiancee) literally provides the so-called heroine with ALL of the ammunition to use against her. Who does that?! While this one has shades of My Best Friend's Wedding, the big difference is that you really don't get invested in any of the characters because none of them are likeable. I just didn't feel the love with any part of this triangle. It was all overly contrived. It's also extremely uncomfortable how the fiance has told EVERYBODY in town her business in the short 6 months she's dated this guy and they're all passing it around like party favors on the eve of the wedding. Every time we see the ex-girlfriend stalking the couple like chewed up, spit out karmic gum on a shoe while pretending to be a videographer, it makes less and less sense. If the groom didn't get rid of her, the bride-to-be should have made it clear that she was NOT welcomed. Note to anyone confused: You should NOT be at your ex's wedding as a single. That's not about insecurity, it's about the energy especially when she looks like a thirsty stripper in every scene. Even a couple of so-called emotional scenes can't save this one. And why was the lesbian hint thrown in?? Too much stuff in the soup without enough quality ingredients. On the bright side, it is a little bit better than Shotgun Wedding. Not by much though.",2/10
Somebody I Used to Know (2023),"Hey, Streamers! It's mid-February, and it seems you either watch romantic comedies or you're anticipating the Big Game. For those who aren't into the latter, here's some more counterprogramming courtesy of Prime Video and the minds of Dave Franco and Alison Brie, Somebody I Used to Know. It's a ""romantic"" comedy involving wedding shenanigans, which we all love. Am I right??? Here's whether you should know this somebody.Dave Franco directs the screenplay he wrote with his wife and the movie's star, Alison Brie. Somebody I Used to Know takes place over a few days in Leavenworth, Washington when Ally (Brie) returns to her mother's home after her reality television show was canceled. While in town on day one, Ally predictably runs into her old flame, Sean (Jay Ellis), after ten years; and they seem to pick up right where they left off. Sean, of course, is hiding the big news of his impending wedding, which leads Ally to go full-on Julianne Potter (My Best Friend's Wedding reference). Wedding sabotage hijinks ensue.This storyline is so tiresome. How many times do we have to see a woman, usually, attempt to sabotage her ex's wedding? Why would anyone think that's going to turn out good for you in the end? Why would you even want someone who was easily manipulated by you? Is that satisfying? I have so many questions for this played-out genre.Now, Somebody I Used to Know steps right into all of the problems with this genre of romantic comedy. It is predictable and unoriginal. In fact, it borrows so heavily from My Best Friend's Wedding that I am now wondering if that was Franco and Brie's objective. It is a shame that this movie feels so derivative because Alison Brie is generally a likeable screen presence. You can easily root for the characters she plays, even someone who is being so manipulative. The one good thing that Franco and Brie have added to this movie is a theme about self-empowerment. The screenplay revisits ideas about making oneself happy, and it is impactful at times. I wish those ideas had been more in the forefront than the wedding sabotage.There really isn't much else here. There's a nice sing-along to look forward to. Haley Joel Osment and Danny Pudi get some good moments, but Osment, in particular, is so unnecessary. That's all really. Eh. *Shrug*Ultimately, Somebody I Used to Know is fine but too derivative, unoriginal and predictable to really be interesting. While the movie hints at other meaningful themes, it settles with the cliches of wedding sabotage movies to be its driving force. That's pretty disappointing. Alison Brie is a pleasant on-screen presence and Haley Joel Osment gets some daffy moments. I'd only suggest a handful of popcorn for this if you need something to fill the time while waiting for Rihanna's halftime show.",5/10
Somebody I Used to Know (2023),"Ally (Alison Brie) runs a superficial reality-TV show. When it gets canceled, she feels empty and decides to go home to visit her mother. She runs into her ex Sean (Jay Ellis) whom she dumped to go to Hollywood. She starts questioning her choosen path.This starts like a Hallmark rom-com. I didn't get Alison Brie doing something like that. My hopes got raised with the two ""That B"". I thought it was Game On. Instead, the story chooses a sincere and sweeter path. It's more than Hallmark, but still very much a version of rom-com. Brie is the co-writer with husband Dave Franco and he's directing.",7/10
Somebody I Used to Know (2023),"As a principal character pointed out with an on-the-nose observation in an early scene, this 2023 romcom felt like a familiar rehash of the Julia Roberts 1997 vehicle, ""My Best Friend's Wedding"". This time, Ally, a reality show producer faces a career crisis and comes home to rural Washington to connect with her old flame Sean from a decade ago only to discover he's getting married to a younger woman Cassidy who is facing her own challenges in abandoning her burgeoning rock music career for marriage. Showing her signature spunk with comic aplomb as Ally, Alison Brie co-wrote the screenplay with her husband Dave Franco who directed. Despite some sharp jabs at reality TV at the outset, their plot follows a predictable path with the characters acting just as you'd expect in their respective predicaments. Jay Ellis is given little to do but act moony or confused as Sean. Kiersey Clemons fares better as Cassidy who recognizes her affinity with Ally. Julie Hagerty displays her trademark ditziness as Ally's sexually active mom, while a still recognizable Haley Joel Osment energetically plays a family friend who is an irritating pop culture geek.",5/10
Somebody I Used to Know (2023),"""Somebody I Used to Know"" is slightly better than other Amazon rom-com efforts but still falls flat. What charm this movie has is mostly driven by grounded characters + the cast and lead's solid chemistry. Other than that it basically follows the bad romcom formula to a T:The 'likeable'/'relatable' lead character is actually unlikable due to their abhorrent actionsIt is mostly directionless and relies heavily on ridiculous drama driven by characters refusing to communicate. Outside of Ally there is basically no organic character/relationship developmentIt heavily relies on childish gross-out/nudity/sex driven humor that isn't funny if you're over the age of 15All of the above combined with a 15 minute too long runtime and the writers thinking people in their mid-30s acting like teenagers is somehow charming results in something 'watchable' but not very engaging.If you liked Community you might enjoy the novelty of seeing Alison Brie and Danny Pudi on screen again. Otherwise, there's not much point in watching this.",4/10
Somebody I Used to Know (2023),"IMDB, you are guys are crazy. I'm genuinely shocked at the pearl clutching in the comments. (Oh my god, how dare someone try and reignite something with someone already in a relationship?! Think of the children!)We, collectively, needed a movie like this. Somebody I Used To Know is one of the sweetest, most earnest, gentle romantic films I've seen in a long time. A movie about love and with no gimmicks: there's no time traveling, no amnesia, no action component. Just a simple story about a girl returning home and remembering a lost love.Alison Brie is wonderful in this movie, and it makes me wonder why or how she hasn't been in a thousand of these movies by now. She's beautiful, funny, has such natural screen presence and chemistry. (And let's be honest, there's no one complaining about her baring it all multiple times) This movie is also a reunion between her and Community co-star (and supposedly really good friend IRL) Danny Pudi, whom was fantastic, but definitely underused. Same with Hayley Joel Osmont, to be honest. This movie presents a fun cast but unfortunately, doesn't have them as present as i'd have liked.But it's okay because as familiar as the story may be, I think it's fundamentally quite strong. Jay Ellis, Kiersey Clemons, and Brie have a great dynamic and I like the subtle mind games and entendres that dominate their conversations in the middle of the movie. But, it gives way to a sweeter, more thoughtful and ultimately, healthier take on love and relationships that I think is a direct response to the tropes of the past.This movie also looks GORGEOUS with the picturesque, highly unique town of Leavingworth, Washington, with its German inspired town centre playing the perfect romantic setting for a movie like this. Honestly, this movie makes me want to visit that town. It looks incredible. But it's also a testament to the cinematography that every image looks so crisp and gorgeous, even if I could've used a bit more cinematic flair.I don't know what to say, I really liked this movie. It felt mature, it felt earnest, it felt right. I genuinely don't understand why the reception has been so negative. This movie is perfect for Valentine's Day.",7/10

Cue passable love triangle shenanigans (inc his family inc Haley Joel Osment, Olga Merediz & Danny Pudi) with a more dramatic than comedic edge (despite some silly slapstick scenes). Franco's second film as director (in which he loves letting the camera drool over his wife btw) is better than the first (""The Rental"") though he's still got room to grow for sure.",6/10

Somebody I Used to Know (2023),"In terms of a rom-com, it's actually enjoyable. Many of the actors do a good performance, and the story is good, but good is all I can say. Alison Brie's character is someone people can understand, but not really relate with. She does come across as selfish and almost sabotaging the wedding just to get back with the guy she loved, and even he acts a bit selfish almost ruining the weekend trying to rekindle his relationship with Ali. One thing I like to see is to stop giving selfish characters the spotlight and where they still come out on top, this is not something that needs to be shown in a positive spin. But Dave Franco is doing a good shop directing movies and I hope more from him and Alison Brie (his spouse) in the future.On a side note, I do like how the main character (Ali) is open with her interests with nudism. As one myself, is nice with the lifestyle in a positive spin instead of always being made for jokes.",6/10
Somebody I Used to Know (2023),Awful movie! Should have known when I saw a Franco wrote/ directed the movie. Allison Brie's character had no scruples or even thought about anything or anyone her libido. Her behavior was vile & why her cleavage was front & center when it was nothing to write home about. No one should see people naked in so many scenes. I guess they needed something to get people to watch it because clearly the plot won't lure people. I should have read the reviews first & that's on me. This movie reeks of desperation & stupidity! You will have a better time watching paint dry. Lack of good movies made me desperate & had me watching it.,1/10

I am certain I saw enough to know I did not care for it. No spoilers here. I won't rehash what other reviewers have correctly pointed out about this film's abundant weak points. For me, the worst part was not being able to appreciate any of the relationships portrayed in this saga. On a more positive note, the locations were really beautiful Also, I can honestly say that the only two characters with legitimate chemistry were Alison Brie and Danny Pudi (real life friends from their years on Community).",6/10

Wouldn't mind seeing him in some other projects.Unfortunately, that's about it on the good stuff. Not much else impressed me. The rest of the cast was 'satisfactory'. They did their jobs. The story line was okay, but I thought ruined by vulgarity and nudism I wasn't expecting; it was just unnecessary and didn't help the plot.And then there's the ending. That's when I decided I really disliked the film.The bottom line here: I don't think this film is going to do any favors in terms of the careers of those involved.",5/10
Somebody I Used to Know (2023),"Completely unlikeable lead - within the first ten minutes I've decided that she deserves whatever pathetic fate matches her decidedly flat and boring existence as a low level celebrity with zero depth or meaning.

Like eating a plain wafer with no flavor. Sad. The basic premise I gathered from the preview seemed like it had far more possibilities that I was looking forward to exploring. Had to turn off. Actual reality tv would be far more engaging than this show about a boring reality tv host.",1/10

I still don't know what the point was and why this film was ever made.The characters didn't really seem to have any chemistry.

Trying to fill space and/or maybe making it funny a very poor try from the ""director"" and a very disgusting move a lot of other scenes. 5,6 rating is too much for this poorly done movie I gave it 1 star rating and if it was on me it should be 0.5.",1/10

When her series is cancelled, she returns to her hometown, where she reconnects with her ex-boyfriend Sean (played by Jay Ellis). The film explores themes of personal growth and the search for true happiness. The comedic moments poke fun at reality TV, but the real heart of the movie lies in the dynamic between Ally and Sean and the rest of the strong supporting cast. The chemistry between Brie and Ellis is instantly believable, and Clemons, Hagerty, and Merediz are standouts as well. Ultimately, ""Homecoming"" is a touching and entertaining film that leaves you rooting for its characters.",8/10
Somebody I Used to Know (2023),"Overall, the movie went in a complete circle and made the plot absolutely useless. The main character portrays a great lack of common sense and does abhorrent things until the very end. There were many characters who made this movie worth watching which is a pro about said film. Its production is ridiculous which in turn made it hilarious at times. It went from a romcom (lacking greatly in the chemistry and comedy department) to nudist propaganda towards the end. Whenever the kid started chasing two naked grown women, I officially marked this movie as unwatchable. The constant usage of the ""boobs and bush"" phrase will forever be traumatically embedded into my mind. Many unnecessary niche parts in the storyline are not only cringeworthy but didn't prove fruitful in regards to the spontaneous ending. This includes: Cassidy kissing Ally (it was obviously a tasteful platonic kiss but given Cassidy's past was constantly about her female exes was this a short attempt to momentarily confuse the audience? It surely worked for me), the entire nudist plot and plethora of naked people (I understand Ally being a naturist/nudist was to uniquely enforce the freedom and dignity towards her character but it seemed completely counterproductive to the plot. If I wanted to watch a nudist documentary I would find one rather than watching something branded as a romcom. Illustrated that Ally finally did the film she wanted to from the start which is positive), and Cassidy's estranged homophobic parents that made a quick appearance (they were quite literally on screen for 3-5 minutes at most to make sure Sean wasn't a ""butch lesbian""). Along with Ally's elderly parents constantly going at it. I'm not completely opposed to characters being placed in a salacious light but I seriously think the time and resources should've been directed towards making a consistent and satisfactory film. I personally don't recommend to watch it as you gain little resolve from the entire movie as it's original plot is never set in stone. If you're looking for a film to watch and cringe at (while yelling commentary at your screen because of how bad it is at times), this is the film for you.",2/10

To me it was all ego and I wasn't rooting for her to have a beautiful life after she tries to blow up her ex's life. Her friend Kayla was more like able then the main character.

Somebody I Used to Know (2023),Hollywood has become a Ford factory assembly line of movies with the same plot for every genre. This was a movie that I thought I knew the ending to before even watching but to my surprise I was wrong in the most interesting way. This was such an easy watch and the plot was more interesting as I watched it. The humor was good bit great but I laughed quite a few times. It was a dramedy that got so much right. I give it such a high rating bc it finally did something new and it worked. We're in a period of remakes and cut/paste romantic comedies. This movie was so refreshing and finally ended in a way that didn't make women look like blood sucking vampires for love.

Cassidy's uninvited parents showing up to the wedding based on a random email only to leave the wedding made ZERO sense. The kiss on the lips between Ally and Cassidy was totally unnecessary and confusing. Then the movie ends with Ally at a nudist resort which I felt was just an excuse for her to be naked in the movie, again it was totally unnecessary. Ally should've visited her rural hometown after the Hollywood dreams didn't work out, ran into Sean, shake up his engagement, and took Sean back with her to LA once her show got approved for another season.

White Noise (2022),"I don't know how to describe this film, but it almost feels like watching 3 different films. It started like a parody of dead poet society, then follows up by a parody of war of the world, then a parody of unfaithful. And it seems like there's no correlation between these sequences.Yes, i'm aware White Noise is a satire of a supposedly average american family dealing with mundane troubles of death, live, love blah blah blah. Yes, i know it's based on a novel. No, i haven't read the novel. But seeing this film as is, and for whatever this film trying to be, i don't find it entertaining.

White Noise (2022),"White noise definition: A constant background noise, especially one that drowns out other sounds. White noise helps get a better quality night's sleep by masking environmental or outside noises that are causing disturbed sleep, thus falling asleep much faster and effortlessly. Exactly.The only difference from the definition and this film's title, is that white noise is constant and soothing, while this boring nonsense excuse of a film was all over the place and annoying. The constant incoherent blabbering and irrelevant convoluted sub-plots became a cringe-fest quickly. The entire runtime was utterly disjointed and exhaustingly unbalanced. Almost every scene had no reason to be included with any other scene. It's a bunch of failed older screenplays shredded then randomly taped together. Even the embarrassingly abundant cheap product placement wont pay the bills for this flop. This has to be the biggest waste of film production I've seen in a long time. Even the talented cast were to be laughed at, not laughed with, which is about the only comedy in this film. All the critics who praised this nonsense clearly inhaled the fumes. So don't waste your time with this even if you're curious, it's 136 minutes of your life you will never get back. This nonsense should be studied in film schools on what not to do. It's a very generous 2/10, only for the decent score and pity for the cast that have to have their names attached to this.",2/10
White Noise (2022),"White Noise is, undoubtedly, the strangest movie Netflix has released this year, which is saying a lot given the competition. The plot is all over the place, the dialogue very stylized, and the overall atmosphere is engaging but off-putting. It's the type of movie that is sure to cause a lot of division in audiences.At its core, White Noise is about a college professor named Jack and his middle class family dealing with their fear of death, but what actually happens is quite complicated. So complicated, in fact, that it feels like three separate movies smashed together. To be fair, the novel is just as ungainly and incoherent, but at least you had the sense that you were the one with the problem. There was a mystique to DeLillo's writing that made it seem like there was a lot going on thematically with the strange choices. But in the movie? It just seems like bad, pretentious writing. I'm not even sure if Baumbach knew what DeLillo's aim was, or if he just guessed.One symptom of this is that the unnatural dialogue stick out like a sore thumb: in a scene where Jack's wife, Babette, says how open she is with communicating her feelings, Driver says ""That is the point of Babette."" In another moment, Jack is shopping with his coworker when said coworker suddenly says that Jack's wife's ""hair looks important."" What is the point of lines like this? Because all it accomplishes is taking you out of the moment and reminding you that you're watching a movie with a script. Not to mention the multiple long, unintelligible ""philosophical"" monologues that occasionally pop up. Is it an intentional commentary on the hollowness of academia? If so, then why are they presented so uncritically and played dead straight? It's just another disjointed element of the movie that seems unfinished.But even if the script fails them, the cast and tech crew don't give up on trying. Driver and Gerwig give very different performances, the former acting almost like an intentional caricature of a sitcom dad, and the latter trying to be serious the whole time. And yet it's one of the few disparate combinations in the film that actually pays off: their acting is convincing as a real couple. Gerwig, in particular, brings emotion to scenes that were completely absent of it on the page. The production design and score are also on point, creating a distinct and interesting atmosphere that also furthers the film's supposed social commentary. But none of this is quite enough to save White Noise from itself and its shortcomings.The best part of the film is far and away the end credits. I'm not saying that as some sort of flippant joke about the movie's quality, it's a genuinely incredible sequence. Somehow it captures the exact type of weirdness and existentialism and fun that's absent from the rest of the movie. It's so good that, in all honesty, you could probably skip the rest of the movie for it. White Noise is consistently watchable and unique, unlike anything else you'll see this year. But it's aimless, confused, and ultimately baffling to make any significant impact.Final Score: 62/100.",6/10
White Noise (2022),"Most of the reviews that I have read thus far were negative, or a bit overly kind. The low rating is likely due to people going out for a light story, expecting to see a disaster action flick or end of the world comedy. This is essentially a reflection on mans fear of his own mortality, or perhaps more specifically on a certain subcultures fixation on their own impending end. If you take the movie as a series of reflections on that idea, and most of the characters as representations of certain personality types, perspectives and ideologies, then it all makes a lot of sense. And, it is pretty damn (darkly) funny as well. Enjoy.",6/10
White Noise (2022),"It's funny when you encounter a film with so many likeable elements that simply never cohere into something that works. This film reminded me of ""I Heart Huckabees"" in that sense ... I enjoyed all the parts considered in isolation, but the film itself is decidedly less than the sum of it's parts.The film is divided into three acts. We're introduced to star professor of Hitler Studies Adam Driver and his wife Greta Gerwig and their children (almost all from different spouses) in the first act, which gestures at parodying academia without really landing much.In the middle act, a train crash causes the Airborne Toxic Event ... a cloud of poisonous chemicals that descends on town and causes the family to evacuate. This is the most successful part of the film, impressively staging the event like a darkly comedic disaster film.The final act is ... a lot less clear and probably best not spoiled. It deals with our need to distract ourselves from the terrors of life with medicine and consumerism. It descends into talky meandering and is really only saved by a magnificent musical number over the end credits.There's really a lot to like. I found it to be intermittently quite funny. The performances are great, especially Don Cheadle as a fellow professor trying to establish a specialization in Elvis Studies. It's a hugely ambitious film with a unique visual style. I only wish I could say I actually liked it.",6/10
White Noise (2022),"First and foremost, this film is misrepresented as ""horror"", something it is not. The use of a suspenseful score to accompany a drawn-out mundane scene is not grounds for a horror consideration.As for the film itself: unbelievably mediocre. The dialogue was non-organic and awkward. Any time something remotely interesting did happen, it was immediately intercepted by awkward conversations and unrelated plot points. A major discussion on death is attempted but the ambiguous dialogue circumvents any meaning from shining through. The film starts with an interesting event of a toxic chemical leak and the societal and familial repercussions-it was intriguing, there was humor, and it was scary at times. Just as it was peaking, it-the cloud of chemicals, and the plot with it-mysteriously disappeared and had no meaningful weight on the film. The ending descended into maintained, boring chaos only punctuated by cheap weirdness and pretentious attempts at character enlightenment and closure.Overall, this film was a monumental waste of 2 hours. An absurd drama-comedy, at best, weakly grasping for a ""thought-provoking"" consideration through cheap suspense and a nonsensical, nihilistic storyline.Don't get me started on that horrible credits scene...",3/10
White Noise (2022),"Started watching and the characters just spoke constantly over each other, no need or desire to think about what they were saying, no clue what they were actually saying, no time to process what they were saying. So I put the subtitles on, that might help I thought, nope, still couldn't keep up, the type of conversation I would find inanely dull in real life and would walk away from. Then after 30 minutes of watching I asked my husband if he had any idea what this film was about, nope he replied. Can we be bothered when we just want to be entertained? Nope. Communication is important in a film, this film finds communication a difficult task. Obviously we turned it off, why waste our time. People state on here that it's thought provoking, well I disagree and think real life is far more thought provoking and entertaining than a family that cannot communicate clearly.",1/10
White Noise (2022),"For the first hour of White Noise, I found myself very entertained. But for the second half I found myself incredibly bored. They felt like two separate films. If the first half had just been the whole film. I probably would have have given this film an 8. Or possibly a 9. It goes from being an apocalyptic family satire, to a revenge tale. I believe Noah Baumbach didn't even know what exactly he was going for. White Noise was average. The two aspects holding me back from giving it a 4 are again the first half and another stellar performance from Adam Driver. Nowhere near as good as Marriage Story. Then again they are very different films.",6/10
White Noise (2022),"I thought this would be interesting and was really interested in the chemical spill part of the movie and I was sure it was going to let that play out. Nope. But that would have been interesting. Instead this movie takes you on a really weird trippy journey in lives of people who just talk a lot. They get most of their words wrong or make up words as they go along and I found that really irritating. I'm not sure what that trope was about but, I hope not to see that again.This is like an over-the-top dram(edy)--even though it isn't funny, about mundane people who can't focus on any one thing to save their lives. A mundane family of which the father is a professor who teaches Nazism (yeah of all things). There are other odd professors also in the same school who teach oddball stuff. One guy thinks Elvis is the sh** and lectures on that, while at the same time loves movie car crashes. None of the movie makes much sense and I became exhausted trying to figure out what they were saying that I just had to give up about 3/4 way through. The chemical spill did nothing for the film unless they wanted to make the movie about that, otherwise it was just there and as unrelated as everything else in the movie.To compare this to anything would be like trying to imagine you have dementia for about an hour and a half. Yup. That is a good summation.",2/10
White Noise (2022),"Greetings again from the darkness. Writer-director Noah Baumbach's latest film is one of those that causes us to feel a bit guilty at not finding it as important or noble as it finds itself. That's not meant to be as critical as it sounds. Afterall, Baumbach is the one who has managed to bring the ""unfilmable"" ... Don DeLillo's 1985 novel (National Book Award for fiction) ... to the big screen. Baumbach's last film was MARRIAGE STORY (2019), a masterpiece on relationships, and while this current film is a more ambitious undertaking, it likely will prove less accessible to many viewers.Adam Driver stars as Jack Gladney, a professor at a (fictitious) midwestern college, who has reached celebrity status through his Hitler studies curriculum - although he remains uneasy at his own inability to speak German. Jack's own home life teeters on bedlam most every day. He and his wife Babbette (Greta Gerwig, director Baumbach's real life spouse) are both on their fourth marriage, and their blended family of kids results in tension and more overlapping dialogue than one would find in a filled sports arena. Babbette is showing signs of early onset dementia, and is regularly and secretly taking a drug called Dylar. Of course, it's the 1980's and Google hasn't been born, so Jack and Babbette's daughter Denise (Raffey Cassidy) find themselves scouring books and asking doctors about the mysterious drug.There are some amazing lines (most taken straight from DeLillo's novel) throughout the film, and Act 1 features a stunning rap-battle type lecture with Jack and his colleague Murray Suskind (Don Cheadle) taking on Elvis versus Hitler and their relationships with their respective mothers. It's filmed like a boxing match and most of the students seem oblivious to this treat. Act 2 is labeled ""The Airborne Toxic Event"" and it's a fiery tanker car (filled with toxic waste) explosion that marks the transition. A mass evacuation takes the family to Camp Daffodil for 9 days, and Jack's limited exposure to the toxic air places him in peril and leads to Act 3 where the fear of death merges with the discovery of Babbette's Dylar source. The question then becomes, will Jack first die or commit murder ... because, as we are told, men are killers.Jack's son is aptly named Heinrich and is played by Sam Nivola (the son of Alessandro Nivola and Emily Mortimer). Baumbach is an intellect obsessed with neurotic intellectual characters, and he thrives at blurring the line between satire and societal commentary ... which is obviously why he was drawn to DeLillo's novel. The film is often chaotic, and is an odd blend of science fiction teasing the end of our world, the price of consumerism, and existential contemplation reflecting our fear of death. Especially effective are the Production Design of Jess Gonchor and the work of composer Danny Elfman. Perhaps there could be no better ending than the dance number in the vitally important local grocery store that continues through the closing credits. The film is funny, frightening, and a bit of a downer that offers more questions than answers - an adaptation that serves the novel.Opening in theaters on December 2, 2022.",7/10
White Noise (2022),"God, this must be THE worst Noah Baumbach movie so far... From the AWFUL opening where they ping pong dialogue between each family member like a carefully constructed sitcom. NO ONE, and I mean, NO ONE speaks like that. It was so painful to watch and I was ready to turn it off right there and then. Just terrible writing. I didn't believe a word of what was said.It is a big Hollywood mistake to make sure not to have actors walk on the other actors lines, but because of it, the dialogue feels wooden, rehearsed and unnatural.The movie was all over the place and din't know what it wanted to be. Not every book needs to be made into a film.I like Noah's other films. Even though he tries to be early Woody Allen, his films has always had a certain quality of realism that I enjoyed. He needs to stick to his own writing which has worked for him.It was almost like Wes Anderson directed this, overly staged and weird.What it showed is that mediocre people can teach unsophisticated vulnerable teenagers and indoctrinate them with such ease.What's really sad is the amount of money they spent on this atrocity.SKIP IT, go watch his earlier films.",1/10
White Noise (2022),"Alright I am just going to say I knew absolutely nothing going in. The film captured me from the very first scene and didn't let go. The style, the statire, the tropes from every last genre of movie! The direction of the scenes down to a Tee. Whoever was in charge of the period sets and styling needs to win something. The supermarket alone is a masterpiece. If you lived in the 70s you will be transported. If you didn't, you will know what it was like.Adam Driver, Greta Gerwig, Don Cheadle- all
amazing performances.I adored this movie and am putting this in my repeat rotation.I have to write 15 more words so here we go did I tel you I loved this film?",10/10
White Noise (2022),"I read a lot of bad reviews here before watching this and still felt sure from the trailer that I'd like it. Nope. If anything, it's worse than the reviews convey: a zany, garish cartoon vision of the '80s that's really nothing like the '80s, with a script that reads like a very bad philosopher or sociologist shoehorning chunks of his thinking into awkward dialogue, and a story that does nothing to carry all that meaning and anyway feels less a story than a series of disconnected, unfunny skits.It's all just so shockingly, tediously try-hard bad - everything: dialogue, performances, sets, camera work - all wildly overdone, a sort of perpetual, manic assault that's hopelessly out of keeping with the cool drollery de Lillo seemed to be aiming for in his book.So much talent involved and no one piped up before it was too late to say, 'We're making a stinker'? How does this happen? OK, Driver, given his deep commitment to Carax's Annette, seems worryingly like he might be into this kind of blow-hard, faux-comical pretension. And de Lillo has written similarly embarrassing would-be clever dialogue for Cronenberg's Cosmopolis. But Baumbach and Gerwig? They usually judge things well. And Baumbach was actually the screenwriter here and, from what I can recall, de Lillo's novel, while nowhere near as funny as it wants to be, is in no way the series of florid, stagey lunges at profundity Baumbach has turned it into.So, I don't know, it's a mystery, but one surely of interest only to film and writing students as an example of what absolutely not to do.",2/10
White Noise (2022),"As someone who didn't read the book the movie is based on, i will say that i did not connect with this movie or the characters. Am ok with not connecting with characters but the characters in this movie are hard to understand which is odd because they talk and talk (usually at 100 miles an hour and over each other) so you think they would be all out in the open but it was like a wall between them and me. Like i completely failed to understand what it was that the author was saying about the world or the country when he wrote the book. Though i assume that the book was making some sort of commentary about the state of affairs because this movie feels somewhat too large in scale to just be a movie about coming to term with mortality and the difficulties that can arise in a marriage. Like the movie isn't bad but what are you? I will watch it again when it comes out on Netflix to try and see it with fresher eyes but if the purpose of the movie is to frustrate people so much that we rewatch it multiple times, i will say that they will succeed.",4/10
White Noise (2022),First off I hate that when they misrepresent a film I was told comedy drama horror it had NO HORROR and the so called comedy was pompous nobody cares comedy. Nothing relatable in anyway had 1 funny line by Don Cheadle otherwise BORING drama with no payoff at all. Also sorry but with the exception of star wars adam driver is VANILLA very mono tone even his voice is mono tone. The whole film is just a waste we we're going to shut it off but figured it might get better but nope ANOTHER OVERRATED film that 1 person give a glowing review so the lemmings masses follow. It's genre is as such: mundane dialogue filled drama.,1/10
White Noise (2022),"What exactly does this film want to achieve? Why should the weird and sometimes paranoid look or angle of a director or script writer be something worth mentioning, let alone made into a movie? I honestly tried to see this movie with as clear a mind as I can... Is there something wrong with me? Is there some secret dimension hidden in this film that I (40 years old) can't grasp? Where is the director looking forward to? Amuse us? Entertain us? Drive us crazy? The last one, he succeeded! What did I watch? A strange, motley family whose members' dialogues use pretentious expressions full of disjointed, meaningless words and a tendency to impress even the teenagers of the family with their knowledge and strange inclinations! Do us a favor... We are not so easy to get. 1/10 from me.",1/10
White Noise (2022),"The film itself is near perfect. Adam Driver and Greata Gerwig were great. Baumbach is at the top of his directing game. Great performances even from the bit characters, great set production, cinematography, music, pacing....everything is just about perfect. The problem is, is the source material. It is an extremally difficult novel to adapt from. The book, while not long, was a heavy, frantic read that would be hard to translate into a screenplay. In my opinion, Noah did a great job. In face, one of the best novel to film adaptions I've seen so far.So if you haven't read the novel, you might be disappointed. If you don't like absurdist comedies, you might be disappointed. If you don't like dry humor, you might be disappointed. So already you can see that the film won't appeal to many, BUT If you have checked all three boxes, than you'll probably enjoy the film.",9/10
White Noise (2022),"Well, the trailer looked interesting but I guess I just can't stand anything this director does, it just makes me anxious and bored and annoyed at the same time, the unnatural dialogue, overacting and complete lack of momentum in all his films. I understand he has many fans, but all his choices just feel wrong. I also thought Marriage Story was unwatchable and gave up after 15 minutes this one I bailed on after 10. It is like a Woody Allen movie without any humour or likeable characters with only the neurosis and anxiety. I am sure I am missing something, and have nothing against arthouse movies or directors but with NB I just don't feel there is anything there. If you got through any of his other movies then you probably don't have the same allergic reaction to his style of filmmaking.",3/10
White Noise (2022),"I'm a fan of Adam, Greta, and Don, but not in this. With Danny Elfman scoring, I wish this had been a Tim Burton movie. Instead, it felt like an unsuccessful attempt at channeling Tim, Wes Anderson and Woody Allen. I grew up in the 80s with a blended family and could not connect with this group at all (the girl in the visor- wth?). The dialogue sounded more fitting for a stage play, coming across forced and overdramatic much of the time. I personally did not find it comedic or scary (horror), which is what we were promised. If this film wants to make a statement about consumerism, how about pointing the finger at yourself filmmakers- did you make this movie for altruistic reasons or were you hoping to make $$$ off those consumers you criticize? The bloated existentialism is annoying- somehow people shopping in a grocery store are guilty of something. Maybe they just want food because they're human and need it to survive. And this somehow relates to fear of death. Well... yeah. If one doesn't eat, one dies. Groundbreaking stuff. I don't have a fear of death that maybe many people do, so I guess it's hard to relate to the messaging here (whatever it is exactly). I'm not sure how Greta's ""important hair"" and the ramblings of the exact terminology of a dark cloud (is it a plume? Or is it more??) fit into all of this. The third act was just silly and boring. But 2 stars for LCD Soundsystem... I wish I could have been dancing in the aisles.",2/10
White Noise (2022),"I didnt laugh once. I smirked once. That was about it.Skip the first 45 minutes. Nothing happens. Then finally after some 45 minutes we get to see some action relieving me from utter boredom. Is the action any good then? NOPE.Too many characters. Too disjointed a story. Too gimmicky kind of OVERacting by the 2 leading characters. Oh yes, and several (not so) sublte hints at politically correct themes from todays politics, although this movie was situated in the eighties, which feels odd.Not any good then at all? It aint terrible, but it is quite BLAND and tedious.I blame the writer. And the director Noah Baumbach. Beware: I ADORED earlier movies by the same director but this story simply had little spark and punch. And with the talent available the director COULD have made something better...To be avoided, EVEN for the fans of Adam Driver and Greta Gerwig, because these 2 are some of my favorite actors, BUT unfortunately even they couldnt elevate this movie to some level that didnt make me wanna fall asleep...",4/10
White Noise (2022),"I have to admire Noah Baumbach for following up Marriage Story with White Noise. Apart from each starring Adam Driver and centring on a family, the two couldn't be more different. One's a deeply emotional, easy to follow, and very moving family drama, and the other one... well, it's White Noise.It's got a premise that's hard to describe. There's a disaster which causes a great deal of panic for much of the film, but it's not the film's entire focus. In some ways, it feels a little like three short films all starring the same characters, and it's a bit hard to figure out how it all connects sometimes.The movie reminded me of other wild, unpredictable, all over the place movies in recent years, like Inherent Vice and Under the Silver Lake, but both of those felt like they had more method to their madness, and were consistent with their craziness.White Noise definitely isn't bad though. Adam Driver is as great as always, there were some funny parts, and much of the first hour or so is quite exciting. I'd say it's the final 45 minutes that have a few parts that drag, but then again, it builds to a good final scene, so make of that what you will.I look forward to seeing what people say when this drops on Netflix (but who knows whether it'll get much attention - it can be hard to predict what will trend). I have no shame in admitting that maybe some of the discussion will help me understand the parts of this film that I didn't quite get from watching it just now.(Also, if the Academy Awards don't nominate the LCD Soundsystem song written for this movie for Best Original Song, then they're cowards and/or they have no ears).",6/10
White Noise (2022),"Dont do it. There's literally no purpose to it and none of it makes since. Def a psychedelic trip or a fever dream feel to it.

And his wife just 'knew he'd be there cause men are killers' when she had no way to know he'd find the add, want pills for himself to stop his fear, set up a meeting with the dude TO kill and she shows up there?! I'm sorry but no. The dialogue half the time doesn't make any since, the entire movie we were confused and not entertained at all. There's no horror and barely any plot as the explosion lasted like 30mins of the movie. Don't waste your time.",1/10
White Noise (2022),"I knew I'd hate this movie just a couple of minutes into it. Nevertheless, I gave it a chance, but had to succumb after half an hour.It's utter drivel. No clear plot seems to emerge, and the acting is completely over the top. The lines are absurd. The 80s setting is kinda amusing at least.It should be said that I hated Noah Baumbach's other movies too, so there's probably something about his message that goes over my head.Watching it felt much like the train crash that is depicted about half an hour into the proceedings.

I didn't eat paint chips, my synapses bridge just fine...and this lurid mess of a flick was just a disjointed exercise in mental bilious regurgitation!!

Plodding, directionless, derivative, disjointed, uneven, messy, pretentious, BORING...where else shall I go???

White Noise (2022),"It's movies like this and ""Everything, Everywhere All at Once"" that put me behind the eight ball because I don't know if they're supposed to be brilliant or simply confounding. I admire the eloquently stated positive reviews for this film by a handful of IMDb members, but they don't help in the long run to convince me that there's much merit to be found in the picture. Yes, there's the angst filled anguish over the meaning of life and death as posited by the main characters, Jack and Babette Gladney (Adam Driver, Greta Gerwig), but the individual chapters of the story seem unconnected and don't have much to do with one another, other than being the proverbial 'day in the life' of the principals. But not an ordinary 'day in the life', but ones marred by a gigantic oil tanker/train collision and a dismal confrontation with a psychobiologist resulting in bullet wounds for our esteemed protagonists. How they wound up in a German nunnery is what still confuses me, but I'm not going back to find out. What I did like was the closing scene for its vitality and color, and coming from an ex-supermarket executive, I'd have to say that was the best looking and most well stocked A&P I've ever seen.",5/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"Wow. The first Top Gun is a classic, and as we all know, sequels/remakes rarely beat the original, especially 36 years later e.g. The Matrix Resurrections. Well, this film just broke that theory.Aside from the adrenaline-pumping edge or your seat action, this story also had heart. It successfully overachieves, and surpasses its predecessor on every level.The directing by novice Joseph Kosinski was outstanding, especially considering this was his fourth ever full length feature film. All the stunts, visuals and V/SFX were breathtaking, and the camera work perfection, that you'll feel you're in the cockpit of the jet. The soundtrack and score was amazing. The 131 min runtime literally flew by with its spot-on pacing. I actually wanted to see more. Casting and performances by all were also perfection, and once again Tom Cruise reminds us why he is still one of the top actors in the industry.There's nothing I can critique or wish was better, as this gem was perfect in every way. Absolutely stunning, action-packed with a compelling and emotional story, as well as being a visual masterpiece. And the fact the dog fights were real and not CGI (actors had to train to fly the jets), just makes this film that much more magnificent. I'll be definitely seeing this again and adding the DVD to my collection. It's a rare perfect 10/10 must see from me.",10/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"If you were a late teen or in your early twenties in the mid 1980's the world was very different. No computers, no mobile phones, no internet, no DVD's. We had cars though, and bikes, and we loved them, and we loved films too. The original Top Gun captured this moment in time perfectly, and gave us a thrilling ride like we had never seen before. The humour, the games, the bikes, the aircraft and my word, those flying scenes. We went back to the cinema to see it again and again, and spent the following decades quoting the movie. As time went on, it remained like a static snapshot in time to perfectly represent that magical point in our lives for so many of us.Now, 36 years later, we are a generation that has lost our parents, we've had our own children who have moved on themselves, and we now approach the end of our own careers and our young selves are gone forever.This film is the missing bookend to that whole generation. The original was there for the start of our young adult lives, and this new film now marks the end. It's magnificent.I'm 55, but yesterday, just for one last night, I was 19 again. Thank you.",10/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"In one of the more memorable lines in the original Top Gun, Maverick gets chewed out by a superior who tells him, ""Son, your ego's writing checks your body can't cash."" Sometimes I wonder if Tom Cruise took that putdown as a personal challenge. No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he's as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he's ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise's regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They're tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, ""Hold My Hand."" It's nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie's ""Take My Breath Away,"" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you're really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that's because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he's trying to show us that there's room for the old and the new to coexist. He's also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions.",10/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"This is one sequel that looked like it would never get made. It was stuck in development ""hell"" for years and years. Then it was delayed by COVID and other issues. Its almost as if we were not meant to see a sequel to Top Gun. But now it is here and the question is, was it worth the wait? The answer is a resounding yes. This is the only sequel I have ever seen that i liked BETTER then the original. EVERYTHING about this film rocks! Tom Cruise is sixty this year but he can still do the job! He is awesome as Maverick capturing emotions and giving a performance that he hasn't given since A Few Good Men. You see Maverick's innate cockiness (something all fighter pilots have I'm sure) but you also see his vulnerability and his pain especially the scenes where he talks about his dead wingman's son and how he can't bear the thought of him dying as well. Jennifer Connally and Miles Teller give great performances as well playing Maverick's love interest and Goose's son. Yes you 1980's music lovers we get to hear Kenny Loggin's Danger Zone at the beginning it is wonderful nostalgia. Oh and I should also mention the aieral sequences are the best and most intense in movie history you are on the edge of your seat the whole time. To wrap it all up I wanted to mention the touching scene where Maverick goes to see his old Top Gun classmate ""Iceman"" who is now an Admiral and dying of throat cancer. Val Kilmer looks so bad because he has had throat cancer and can no longer speak well. The scene is so sad but they have a joke at the end where he asks Maverick who the best pilot is? Go see this movie by all means!",10/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"I was reluctantly dragged into the theater, thinking that they didn't need to make a Top Gun 2 and that the first one was where that story needed to end.I could write a couple paragraphs to summarize my feelings after walking out of the theater, but I'm going to leave it with just one sentence.I was wrong.",10/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),If there's any movie that deserves to be seen in the theaters with big screens and booming speakers. It's :Top Gun Maverick.One of my best experiences in years!,10/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"What an excellent sequel - I, in fact, like it more than its predecessor.'Top Gun: Maverick' is fantastic, simply put. I was expecting it to be good, but it's actually much more enjoyable than I had anticipated. The callbacks to the original are expertly done, the new characters are strong/well cast, it has plenty of meaning, music is fab and the action is outstanding - the aerial stuff is sensational.The story is superb, with each high stake coming across as intended - parts even gave me slight goosebumps, which is a surprise given I'm not someone who has a connection to the 1986 film. It's all super neatly put together, I honestly came close to giving it a higher rating.Tom Cruise is brilliant as he reprises the role of Maverick, while Miles Teller comes in and gives a top performance. Jennifer Connelly is another positive, though her role does kinda feel a tiny bit forced in order to have a love interest; given Kelly McGillis' (unexplained) absence.Monica Barbaro stands out most from the fresh faces, though I actually did enjoy watching them all - which is something I thought the film may struggle with, adding new people, but it's done nicely; sure Jon Hamm and Glen Powell are a little cliché, though overall I approve.A great watch - I'd highly recommend it, though naturally would suggest watching the previous film first if you haven't already.",9/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"Top Gun (1986) made Tom Cruise a star, and now 36 years later he jumps back in role of Pete Mitchell AKA Maverick almost like he never left.Maverick never seems let his age slow him down, and still is cocky has ever, and is ordered to train a bunch of young pilots for a deadly mission, but sees a little bit of himself in them, and must get them working together has a team.Tom Cruise is great has Maverick, who is coming to terms with the past. Miles Teller and Glen Powell are also great, and not to mention Jennifer Connelly. But the flying scenes are what makes this movie, you feel like your flying with them. Feels has real has ever. A terrific sequel 36 years worth the wait.",10/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),There are so many references to the original that I was brought to childhood when I had first seen it.The best cinematic experience of my life and a perfect gift to all Top Gun fans.,10/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),5 out of 5 stars.Top Gun Maverick is an awesome action film that lives up to the original film and way superior as well. It is one awesome thrill ride that will have the audiences gasping for air with its exhilarating aerial combat scenes.The plot is great. It continues with Maverick (Tom Cruise) being assigned to train new pilots before they go off on a challenging mission. Rooster (Miles Teller) is among the recruits which Maverick tries to reconnect after the incident with his father in the previous film.The plot tries to build an emotional powerhouse as Maverick are neck to neck about the past. And Maverick trying to get these pilots prepared for there first combat.The script is great and fast moving. Director Joseph Kosinski nails making a blockbuster film. Making the action sequences cinematic. And big and loud. Majority of the action scenes are practical and realistic which makes it better. The climatic sequence with the pilots on the mission was awesome and thrilling. Definitely worth seeing this film on the biggest screen with great sound quality.The cast ensemble is great. Tom Cruise nails making a big action film. Cant wait to see what he does with his next films. Miles Teller also was good. Jennifer Connelly playing Mavericks past love interest. The new additions were all great as well. The music score was awesome.The opening sequence gives you the chills with its similiarities to the first.Top Gun Maverick is one of the best films this year. Amazing action sequences that is cinematic and big. And big film that deserves to be seen in theatres.,10/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"See? This is why I LOVE Tom Cruise Post-Mid-1992. Aside from the RARE misfire, cough, cough, The Mummy, when Tom Cruise wants a movie to be better than perfect, he pushes it past Mach 10.The first half of this adventure made me feel this is the perfect and worthy sequel to the original. AND THEN...the second half kicked in thoroughly SURPASSING the original by a landslide. Now, it certainly will not have the impact on the 2020s as the original did for the 1980s - that's lightning that can't be caught twice. But, rest assured: this simultaneously saluted the 1986 classic and then told it to hold its beer.Maverick never changed. And just went he was about to use up his seemingly endless supply of luck, he got recruited back into the ""Top Gun"" division to get the elite ready for a, dare I?, almost Impossible Mission. Oh, and there's a ton of drama and obligatory dick-measuring thrown in.What matters most is: the setup for the film takes place perfectly in the first act giving us clear direction (something the original lacked,) and gave us goals with character building to anticipate and cheer on. When the climax began, it's WAS exactly what I wanted, until it went on another 15 minutes to make the movie SOAR beyond my expectations.While the acting was superb from the Veterans, it wasn't all that great from the fresh new recruits. That was to be expected. Much like their characters in the movie, they're learning to be the best. And they may someday.The movie's music is not as great as the original, but the movie used it sparingly, correctly and with some great new tracks. The original knew it had a killer soundtrack and overdid it. This one showed the restraint it needed.If you loved the first one, there's virtually no way you wouldn't love this even more. It's absolutely perfect for those who were there buying tickets for the original and it's also great for newbies so they can learn to appreciate the classics and understand: with age comes experience and that should never be mocked. It should be learned from and used to progress.And to Top it all off, all of the practical stunts and aerial shots made 10x more sense and easier to follow this time around. I just rewatched the original last night for only the second time (the first being on home video in 2015) and my head was literally spinning to follow the action in the sky. Here, they make sure no one is left in the dust.I can't recommend this movie enough and to see it in theatres, preferably a Dolby-certified one. Don't wait for Paramount+ to pick this up (like I normally would.) Go see this now on the big screen as it should be seen and don't miss out like I did with the original in 1986.***Final Thoughts: I *just* made my Top Ten Tom Cruise movie list, time to update it:1.

Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"I don't share everyone's unbridled enthusiasm for this film. It is indeed a great popcorn flick, with outstanding aerial photography and maneuvers. But 10 stars? There are few, if any, movies that are perfect, and deserve that kind of rating.The problem with the film is the plot. It is so filled with age-worn cliches that one could easily tell what was coming from beginning to end. I mean, you had to know who was going to save the day at the end, and you had to know what was going to happen when Maverick jumped out of Penny's window. Those are just two examples of the many obvious plot points that you could see coming a mile away. I could list them all, but it would take up too much space here. Basically the entire plot was entirely predictable.The opening scene, especially, was straight out of Hollywood Screenplay Writing 101. I mean, seriously, how many times have we seen that subplot? Countless.There were no characters in the movie, either. They were all caricatures, stereotypes. No depth to any of them. They had their standard roles to play, and that was it.Did I enjoy the film? Sure, it was fun. Especially on a big theater screen with a loud sound system. Did I take anything away from the film? Did it make me think about anything after it was over? Nah. Will I see it again? Nah.I will give Tom Cruise credit for including Val Kilmer in the cast. Considering his health problems, that was a nice touch.So, yeah, enjoy the film. Sit back with your bag of popcorn and enjoy the g-forces. But don't pretend it is anything other than just another summer blockbuster.",7/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"It makes more than sense to have seen the first Maverick movie. I am writing this with that in mind. Actually I would even argue that the rating also had something to do with it. Watching it on the big screen also helps a lot of course. My summary line is actually a quote from the movie. Not just the first one, but one that is being said here too. And you will get the full impact of that sentence, of those words, if you know what they mean and why they are said.There are quite a few connections to the first movie, but there is also nods to real life. Especially with Val Kilmer in mind. And all is serving the story - even the real life struggle Kilmer has, that gets woven into the character Iceman. So there are two of the big stars of the first one name checked - what about Kelly McGillis though? Well don't hold your breath (it is being taken away, sorry for the pun)! She is not returning. Now you could be mad at the movie for that - or you could salute it for bringing ""back"" a character that was only name checked in the first movie - and being played by the wonderful Jennifer Connely.Now is she as beautiful as ever? Yes. But she is also close to the age of Tom Cruise that some other names could have been. Of course do not overthink the age thing, because you'd find that her real age would have been inappropriate during the time of the first movie ... just saying. Again: do not overthink it at all.Those things out of the way, we get introduced to a whole bunch of new characters. There probably is not as much ... well male on male energy here as there was in the first one. Even in the dialog - you just feel it. Don't give me that look (and yes I know it is the only one you've got - especially when I bring the puns)! There is more than a coherent story - and the movie takes its time to tell it. There is plenty of action too.There is also technical talk that I didn't totally understand. But it is not necessary to get the movie or enjoy it. And then there is the ending - and what a perfect ending this has. So much so, that I decided it deserves the 10 rating I finally gave it. It may copy many things from the first movie (call it homage), especially the intro but also some story beats, but it still stands ... or rather flies on its own! Just buckle your seatbelt, because you may get dizzy.First time watching I could spot the music cues from the first one, but there were also some fresh elements to it. If I didn't know Lady Gaga was at least partly (big parts if I understood correctly) responsible for the soundtrack, I wouldn't have guessed myself to be honest. As it is, one of the biggest highlights in cinemas this year - the waiting was worth it. If you feel the need .. the need for speed - your need will be satisfied here (or rather in cinemas). Even being able to predict story points will not take away anything from the experience you can have with this. Enjoy.",10/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"I appreciate the first film but never been a massive fan of it so I was not expecting much from the sequel. I was surprised how good this movie was, it's terrific. Also was great to see no woke nonsense and strong characters, thank you Tom Cruise.",9/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"Greetings again from the darkness. Heavy on melodrama. Heavy on cockiness. Heavy on fighter jets. Heavy on nostalgia. Check. Everything that we want and expect in the long-awaited sequel to the 1986 film is present. It's a movie spectacle featuring one of the few remaining bonafide movie stars front and center, as well as breathtaking action sequences that beg to be experienced on the largest screen possible and with the highest quality audio available. Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr are credited for the characters, while the new screenplay involved collaboration from Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren Singer, Christopher McQuarrie, Peter Craig, and Justin Marks. The original film's director, Tony Scott, passed away in 2012 at age 68, and Joseph Kosinski (OBLIVION, 2013, also starring Tom Cruise) takes the helm.Callbacks to the original are plentiful, and we get our first in the opening title card - the same one used in 1986 to explain the ""Top Gun"" training center. Of course, there is one reason we are here, and that's Tom Cruise. He was only 24 years old in the original, and now lives and exudes the swagger of Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell. When the film opens, Maverick is an extreme test pilot pushing himself and an experimental aircraft to Mach 10, and yes, this goes against the wishes and order of the program's Rear Admiral in charge played by a curmudgeonly Ed Harris. It's a shame that Harris only has a couple of brief scenes, but he is the one that informs Maverick of his new orders to return to Top Gun immediately. His new commanding officer is Beau ""Cyclone"" Simpson (Jon Hamm), who is none too happy about Maverick being back. However, the order came directly from Maverick's old nemesis/friend, Tom ""Iceman"" Kazansky (Val Kilmer), now a highly decorated Admiral in failing health.Maverick is disappointed to learn that he has been brought in, not to fly, but to teach a group of Top Gun graduates how to execute an extraordinarily dangerous mission involving extended high speeds at a low altitude, dropping bombs on the uranium enhancement plant protected by a mountain range, and then immediately elevating to a nearly impossible level to avoid a crash - all while being targeted by the enemies radar and defense system. The enemy goes unnamed so that the movie can remain timeless and avoid any type of political backlash. Plus, this film is about thrills and action, not a political statement.Being back means Maverick crosses paths with Penny Benjamin (Jennifer Connelly), who was mentioned briefly in the first film as an Admiral's daughter. She now owns the local bar, has a daughter, races sailboats, and still carries a bit of a torch for Maverick, although she's quick to bust his chops whenever possible. However, it's the pilots he's charged with training that cause the biggest issue for Maverick. One of them is Bradley ""Rooster"" Bradshaw. Rooster is the son of ""Goose"" (played in the original by Anthony Edwards), who flew with Maverick as his Radio Intercept Officer (RIO) and died in an ejection mishap. Rooster holds Maverick responsible and Maverick is still haunted by his friend's death. Goose is seen in photos and via flashbacks, and Rooster emulates his dad at the bar's piano. The conflict between Rooster and Maverick adds complications to the mission - and a bit of melodrama to the entire film.The newbies (and the Navy) consider Maverick a relic of a bygone era, so of course, 'instructor' Maverick takes to the sky to strut his pilot stuff. In addition to Rooster, the standouts in the new group include Phoenix (Monica Barbaro), Bob (Lewis Pullman), and Hangman (Glen Powell), the latter of whom, along with Rooster, tries to recreate that symbiotic relationship we originally saw with Iceman vs Maverick. Teller and Powell are both solid, but this aspect never really clicks like the Rooster vs Maverick piece.We can't help but notice that the dramatic elements seem to be more of a focus this time around. The biggest impact comes from the scene where Mavericks visits Admiral Kazansky (Iceman) at his home. Despite his well-known physical limitations, Val Kilmer delivers a memorable performance, and the two actors seem to relish this opportunity. The situation is handled with grace, and we are appreciative of Cruise standing firm in his demand for Kilmer to appear in the film. As for the love story between Penny and Maverick, it had to be a bit frustrating for Ms. Connelly to work so hard on an underwritten role, while Jon Hamm's constant furrowed brow and barking leaves him coming across as little more than jealous of Maverick.Obviously it's the fighter jets and aerial sequences that folks will come for, and spectacular and exhilarating are the best words I can find to describe what we see. I was fortunate to see his in IMAX, and if you have one near you, it's certainly the preferred viewing format. Thanks to the Navy and the training and equipment received by the cast, there is an authentic feel that's almost throwback in this day and age of CGI. We sense the speed and gravity pulls, even if we are never in peril. The aircraft carrier sequences are mind-boggling, though it's jets in the air that provide the energy jolt.Wise-cracking and heartstring-tugging moments fill the screen, and you can relax knowing Kenny Loggins' ""Danger Zone"" is back, while Berlin is thankfully not. Sand volleyball has been replaced by some semblance of shirtless and sweaty beach football as a team-builder, and yes, we get the patented Tom Cruise sprints - three times: on a treadmill, during beach football, and in a forest. The familiar sounds of Harold Faltermeyer's original score are back, this time enhanced by Hans Zimmer and an ending song by Lady Gaga. Those from the original who are absent this time are the great Tom Skerritt, James Tolkan, Kelly McGillis, and Meg Ryan (whose character is mentioned as having passed away). Producer Jerry Bruckheimer is back, though his partner on the original, Don Simpson, died in 1996 at age 52. Deserving of kudos are cinematographer Claudio Miranda, film editor Eddie Hamilton, and those involved with sound, visual effects, and music. For those feeling the need for speed, this sequel delivers; just embrace the cliches and familiarity, and predictability.Only in theaters (as it should be) Friday May 27, 2022.",8/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"Having loved Top Gun, I clearly wasn't going to miss Top Gun: Maverick, and also being a fan of Tom Cruise, I knew the best place to watch it would be the big screen. I totally enjoyed the film as I watched it with a helping of popcorn. There were moments where I felt excited, emotional and even laughed along with the other viewers. It delivers light, simple and sweet entertainment in a delicious mix of action, drama, some romance and humor in a delightful manner.Tom Cruise shines in his performance where he is required to display a good range of emotions and has a good chemistry with Jennifer Connelly, while also impressing us in the action sequences as he always does. Speak of which, the action is very beautifully executed as well as filmed. Every time the jets turned, I felt like my head moved along in the same direction. This effect is repeated multiple times and ends up immersing the viewer into the thrill of the action. It's very clean and neatly done, and never violent at all. The film has no adult content, due to which you can watch it with your families.The music and score are terrific, and the cinematography is another major plus. Some might find the initial few acts a little slow, but the action sequences completely steal the show, especially in the lengthy and spellbinding final act. The editing is top notch, as the film never feels long or stretched. I was actually surprised how short it felt, and in a good way. Top Gun: Maverick is a very feel-good action movie with realistic action and emotions to deliver an experience of a lifetime. If you enjoyed Top Gun, chances are you will find yourself loving this film even more, for Cruise once again proves he's the man to look for when quality action is what viewers crave. Must watch on the big screen. Period.",10/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"Greetings from Lithuania.I wasn't the biggest fan of first ""Top Gun"" movie. I saw it like 5 years ago so for me it wasn't nostalic or anything. It was just OK movie and nothing more.Today i saw ""Top Gun: Maverick"" (2022) in cinema. And it blew me away. This movie was incredible. It literally put a smile on my face. Action scenes in the air were the best i ever saw of this type of action. Directing by Joseph Kosinski was perfect. Music was on spot. Cinematography was gorgeous. I loved how actually calm and quite this movie was, until it wasn't and transition between scenes, acts, calm and action was perfect. Acting was great. This is a movie making as good as it gets. Was it predictable? Yes. But at the same time i was excited and glued to the screen during its whole 2 hours run time.Overall, ""Top Gun: Maverick"" is a Hollywood blockbuster done right. Its a Hollywood action adventure movie in every possible way, yet this time its done incredibly good. What a terrific sequel.",10/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"Tom Cruise is still an ultimate being at 59 years old it's outstanding! Top Gun: Maverick deserves so much for how practical everything is. Great the IMDb rating is 8.7 hope it stays high, should even get awards. The music hit the spot, cinematography is beautiful, the story flow well, and the acting is incredible so much so that even though Val Kilmer has mouth cancer in real life he has a small part in the film. I like how the main characters trained for a near impossible mission that all was built up quite well.",10/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),This is one of the best theatrical experiences I've had and I'm so happy someone has taken the practical route rather than throwing everyone into a green screen. I watched the first one many times and I can't believe this just topped it by a huge margin. Tom Cruise will be written as the most passionate filmmaker in history. I mean to put a whole cast in a bunch of f-18 jets and act in a jet as well as film yourself is a huge deal. If this movie does not cross a billion then there is something wrong with taste that people have these days. So called marvel fans. This is what you call a cinematic experience. Not some cropped cgi scenes.,9/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"Wow! As a retired combat veteran who has flown jets, I LOVED THIS MOVIE! It had massive heart, great action and wonderful Cameos. The flying scenes were the best I've seen. Nobody left the theater for 90 minutes!",10/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"I'll preface my review by first stating that I had mediocre expectations coming in. It's very hard to make a successful sequel to an older classic movie, but I was immediately entertained from beginning to end. I won't give any spoilers, but I'll list my biggest takeaways from the movie.1. The flying scenes were incredible and had me on the edge of my seat.2. Tom cruise and miles teller were awesome.3. I want to quit my job and become a fighter pilot now.This movie is definitely worth paying for imax tickets and I suggest you get a big water bottle cause you will be sweating profusely as Maverick cuts through the sky like butter.",9/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"I absolutely fell in love with this movie from the first intro scene with the synthy tones and footage similar to the first film, through to the story development and action, and the high stakes heist style mission and conclusion.The entire movie is a well thought out and very well delivered action movie with some character development for Maverick and some heartwarming stuff as well as he overcomes some unfinished business lingering from the original movie.There are some nods and throwbacks to the classic movie, and I admired them all. The romance segments were kept short and neat this time around, giving some growth and redemption for our hero without dulling the sharp storytelling.After watching I was smiling from ear to ear. Another shout out to the action here, as it is nothing short of spectacular. There is nothing like it, with the air to air combat being of a level not filmed before in my opinion.9/10 loved the characters, loved the production, loved the action, loved the heist style story, and loved seeing Maverick on his last mission for the navy.",9/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"Just Saw This In IMAX and guys what an experience it was.Components of this Movie-1. Firstly what a cast! EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER seemed like they were having a Great Time Acting in this movie. INCLUDING the serious minded Admirals. Great Performances all around.2. Every Scene flows so well. The time flew by.3. Many of the Jokes Landed Strongly throughout the Movie with the audience I was with. Especially the ""You Told Me Not to Think"" Scene. 😂🤣4. The Visuals of the Fighter Jet Scenes were Astonishing. They looked so good.5. The Story was good enough, on top of that, the suspense was built up throughout towards the Actual Mission. With The Training Missions and Different Conundrums the Team Faced.Overall, What A Movie and Going Further, What an Experience it was.",10/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"Firstly before my small complaint I will point out that I do like the movie.Now the complaint. This movie uses the exact same formula as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it remakes the original film almost scene for scene and adds a few new bits. Both films treating the audience with a little bit of contempt whilst cashing in on the nostalgia market.Having said that, its a fun movie. Teller, as Goose 2.0, works particularly well. It was also great to see Kilmer, despite his current health concerns (he could have been a dynamo for the film if well).Its fun, loud and obnoxious which is what a Top Gun movie should be :)",7/10
Top Gun: Maverick (2022),"Based on the scores, I was expecting a much better film. But I now get it., its the nostalgia for the first film that fuels the scores for this film.Here is my take and why I think its an ""okay"" film, just not a great one. There really isn't a whole lot of meat and potatoes to this story. It's largely a copy pasta in large chunks from the older film but with newer,
younger faces. Maverick is charged with training a squadron of top gun fighter pilots to destroy an enemy uranium enrichment plant that is about to come online and operational. But it seems the producers want to maximize the profits for this film and not offend anyone in the real world. So this enemy doesn't have a name or a geographical location. The enemy has 5th generation fighter jets and some James Bond evil villian sized SAM batteries around the mountain's summit. It is a snow covered terrain so that rules out many enemies in warmer climates.Then there is the lone aircraft carrier delivering these jet fighters to the enemies doorstep. Well, by now most people know that wouldn't be the case. Carriers are heavily guarded and their presence would trigger the attention of any adversary. No way could four F18 sneak in under radar to blow up this plant unless we accept the enemy isn't aware of a huge freakin carrier of their shores. So there is nothing resembling a realistic scenario and that kept me from enjoying the story too much.The romantic relationship in the film has no chemistry. I just didn't feel any chemistry between Penny and Maverick. That's a first because you do have two very good looking actors and I always thought Tom Cruise to be great action actor. So no chemistry between Cruise and Jennifer Connelly is a bitter pill to swallow.What I did like about it was the cinematography and some of the action sequences with the dog fighting. But I didn't think the dog fighting were any better than the original film. In fact, the original film might have had better scenes. This film just has a lot of choppy editing to imply action.I think its a 6/10, but not a chance it's a 9/10. Maybe if they added a Tom Clancy inspired screenplay to the film I might have given it a 9. Maybe a team of seals to do recon before having the jets engage and with the aircraft carrier companied by a battlegroup flotilla. Aircraft Carriers just don't end up secretly off the shore of adversarial country completely alone, not in the real world.",6/10
Plane (2023),"Here was a movie that delivered exaxtly what I paid for. I went on a Friday night. Got a burger and a beer at the bar next to the theater, then got to watch a perfect Friday night movie. We need more of these types of films. Thrilling, edge of your seat action. Cool characters. Beautiful women. Dangerous bad guys. I think the important thing is not to over think it. Gerald Butler was perfect for the role. I could have seen Harrison Ford play this part well 30 years ago. Mike Colter was great as well. Looking forward to more with him. Overall, this one is definitely worth your time if you want a action 101 Friday night flick.",9/10
Plane (2023),"Yeah, it's constructed entirely out of familiar parts, without a single groundbreaking or original element. But Plane is able to fly above its generic ground by making the most of its actors and inherently tension-rich premise.Gerard Butler actually gives his best performance in years here. If this was just a paycheck for him, he certainly doesn't act like it.And director Jean-François Richet wisely paces the film in such a way that the characters have tangible time to breathe and take in what's happening between bursts of frantic action. He allows his actors time with lengthy shots to display the emotion their characters ought to feel.And because we see the characters feeling it, we feel it too. Even though the plot is largely predictable and formulaic, I felt the white-knuckle tension of the brutal action and the entire unhinged hostage situation because the visual focus of the director is always on the people in this story and the fear they feel.Richet uses almost exclusively handheld camerawork for this film, and I have mixed feelings on that. It does help with chaotic sequences to elevate the unease, but it also hinders the film when we should be seeing the outcome of fight sequences and it's sometimes obscured.Although I probably won't be watching it again and will likely forget about it soon, this is a surprisingly more-than-functional action flick that is certainly worth a watch for escapist entertainment.",7/10
Plane (2023),"I figured out pretty early on that it didn't take itself seriously or at least Gerard Butler didn't.14 pax out of Singapore just before Christmas? The flight should have been full. There were lots of errors in predeparture and the comms with the tower when they taxi for take off. And no other planes? The set up was easy to see, prisoner being transported, bad storm and then we're off.This had all the hall marks of Die Hard, Lethal Weapon and any other action film you can think of from the 80s. After all the dross coming out of Hollywood why not just bring a film out to do one thing and that's entertain. And that's what it did. No woke (and that's a word I hate) message, no easily identified alphabet people (because it didn't matter). Just an action film, a hero and the usual tropes to propel it along. Believability played no part as it didn't in Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Commando or Rambo (and any subsequent parts). Just a hero, a dubious helper (the prisoner, who's part was never explained but had skills) , a hapless bunch of passengers and some native evil doers with guns. Let the popcorn flow.I wish they had done more with the passengers, they turned out to be just there and will not be remembered. They certainly could have amped it up more and taken the 80s action higher but it was a good time waster and I felt no need to think beyond what was shown. Hence I didn't care about the errors.It's a 6 because it entertained me without preaching like most films do at the moment. But for God's sake, NO SEQUEL!",6/10

It's not bogged down with any unneeded girlfriend in distress or other unnecessary plot fillers dragging it down. Just plane old action-and no snakes, either. Gerard plays the pilot of an airplane that is transporting a criminal-Mike-when the plane goes through some bad weather and looses all power. Gerard crash lands on the first place he can make it to but, unfortunately, it is an island controlled by unfriendly rebels. Evan plays the leader of the rebels that usually kill-or ransom and then kill-any foreigners that come across their path. Tony plays the head of the airline Gerard works for and he is trying to locate the plane so he can send in a rescue squad-want to bet on whether they make it in time or not?It's rated R for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 47 minutes.I liked it and would buy it on Blu_Ray.",8/10

Heck, I even got frequent flyer miles.Here on Flight 119, Butler as Captain Brodie Torrance, does what he always does best. He makes you believe, and he kicks a little butt.Dare I say that his character participates in a one-on-one fight scene so intimate and visceral that it could hang with anything seen in a Raid film (major compliment!) or even, yes, the new Avatar sequel. It's true.There are other actors, longtime veteran character actors as part of the passenger list, or airline administration in this movie that are an absolute joy to see on the screen.Joey Slotnick (Twister) as a pain-in-the-neck passenger, you just know something is going to happen to him and it ain't good!Paul Ben-Victor (Body Parts) as a by-the-book airline executive, and Tony Goldwyn (Ghost) always bringing his best to every role. No different here.Two standout performances by co-star, Mike Colter as Louis, a prisoner on international transport on this relatively empty New Year's Eve commercial flight, and lastly, the jaw-droppingly gorgeous flight attendant, Bonnie played by Daniella Pineda. Wow.I will say this, there is no end scene but there most definitely should have been one with one of those characters for sure. I won't reveal who.The movie is a tight hour and forty-seven minutes which is most welcome in a world where it seems every movie regardless of genre or content easily runs well over two hours.Are there far superior plane crash/disaster films? Sure.Castaway comes to mind. Even Con-Air, which this seems to pull from just a bit.But this is a very good brainless movie. Just take your brain out before watching, eat your popcorn and enjoy.This is an entertaining and needed theatrical release. It may not be that original but at least It's not a comic book movie, or a sequel or prequel.Now return your tray tables to their full upright and locked positions and fasten your seatbelts.It's gonna be a bumpy (but fun!) ride!",7/10
Plane (2023),PLANE is an almost perfect movie.Gerard Butler does is a different kind of action hero; more cerebral than violent while the younger guys do most of the violent parts.The bad guys; a bunch of (at least form me) unknow Asian guys are really terrifying.There no inserted romances or nice ladies in what is basically a male movie.The story itself is simple; a plane drops by accident in an island managed for some separatist rebels. The plane has no way to communicate its position and things become a survival game just for a short while.Not abusing spectators patience. The duration es perfect.There are couple of short tender scenes but delay the events for a few minutes; but that is nothing compared with the tension it generates the whole time.In brief; is an excellent emotional movie that deserves an audience.,9/10
Plane (2023),"The CG isn't convincing but that can't stop Plane from being a great 90s throwback that knows exactly how to execute all the expected genre tropes in fun and satisfying fashion and further proves that leading man Gerard Butler is the current king of B movies.Butler himself gives a terrific lead performance, charming and confident with the ability to humanise his leading man in a few scenes that linger on the shock and horror at the situation. Mike Colter is great with a deliberately closed off performance that makes him hard to read in a way that increases the tension.Together the two of them make for a likeable duo and don't overdo it with the rapport. Also worthy of mention is Tony Goldwyn whose character may be one note but he elevates the role so much and rescues his scenes out of their mundane nature.Jean-François Richet's direction is so good, the camera is constantly mobile and most importantly always comprehensible with a standout one take early on that kicks things off beautifully. The music by Marco Beltrami and Marcus Trumpp is so overly dramatic and that's exactly why it works.The pacing is basically perfect as well, at a tight 107 mins it doesn't even come close to over staying it's welcome, taking just the right amount of time to set everything up and build up to the crash and once they're on the island it just goes and does not let up.",8/10
Plane (2023),"3 out of 5 stars.Plane is an action thriller that takes you on the edge of your seat thrills and has some action sequences that entertains. The films direction is flat and decent with everything else. The plot is okay. Its about a pilot after getting hit by a storm. Him and the passengers land in a hostile country. Which the passengers gets taken hostage. He and a prisoner who was also on the plane try to go on a search and rescue.The cast ensemble is decent. Gerard Butler is usually good with the performances. Mike Coulter is decent with his role. The film can be a little dull with the performances. The action sequences are nothing new but it does have some exciting moments.Overall, it is an okay film that passes the time.",6/10
Plane (2023),"Plane reminds me of the action movies of my youth. Most 90s action movies are pretty bad by today's standards, but I don't mind going back to the feel of those movies, modernized and updated to the latest action standards. Plane does this fairly successfully, yet still falters when it comes to making a good overall movie.The action itself is pretty good for the most part, although there isn't much of it. There's a pretty tense scene early on, a gritty fight scene I really enjoyed, and a mediocre finale sequence. Three action scenes isn't enough for a nearly 2 hour movie.Everything is surface level. There is no depth. It's filled with subplots but none of them are fleshed out even a little. And there is definitely some dumb stuff, like the worst customer service associate in movie history, or moronic side characters. There are a couple extra cheesy moments as well. I rolled my eyes multiple times.This review may seem very negative, but I did mostly enjoy this movie. It's more than serviceable. I just wish it was better, especially since I'm exactly the target demographic and am prone to liking dumb action movies. I hope we see more attempts at modernized 90s throwbacks, but done right.

Plane (2023),"Plane comes from French director Jean Francois Richet (Assault on Precinct 13) and stars Gerard Butler and Mike Coulter. This movie just works, with no shaky cam and minimal but seething score behind it, Plane rumbles right through at a taught 1:47, and I just got a huge kick out of it.Though the trailer tells you exactly what the movie is and boy do they just run with it.The minimal cgi and VFX May baffle modern audiences but this works a throwback to the 1990s with clear and propelling action scenes with great camera work as well.Plane has a great action, a surprisingly full cast given the premise, and Jean Francois clearly knows what he's doing.See this in the theatre if you can. 7/10.",7/10
Plane (2023),"Captain Brodie Torrance (Gerard Butler) is flying a budget airline plane from Singapore to Tokyo on New Year's Eve. The plane is old and there are only a few passengers. One of them is fugitive Louis Gaspare (Mike Colter) being transported back to the United States. Lightning strikes during a storm and the plane goes down onto a lawless Philippines island.Realism goes out the window after the lightning strike. I have to say that it's a fun disaster movie for a little while. I expected the plane to land safely. I expected bad CGI. I didn't expected that even the little things are unrealistic silliness. For example, there is no way that Brodie would walk ahead of Louis when the two of them set off on their quest. It doesn't hurt the movie to do it the right way, but they insists on doing the wrong way. I also really hate the cartoon villains. They could be more interesting, but the casting director obviously pulled them out of villains R us. By the time of the Rambo action shootouts, I'm almost giddy from drinking the B-movie Kool-Aid. This is a B-movie and everybody is doing their B-movie best. I do wish for something better.",5/10
Plane (2023),"So far, this is the best action thriller for 2023 and was surprisingly amazing. It certainly lived up to my expectations and even exceeded them. Sure, it could've had more Hollywood-styled adrenaline-pumping action, but I actually enjoyed French director Jean-Francois Richet's style of keeping it mostly tame, but also having the suspense and thrills constant throughout the entire 107 min runtime, with the added bonus of perfect pacing. Newb co-writers Charles Cumming and J. P. Davis gave us a great screenplay with excellent continuity and flow. All casting and performances were spot-on with Gerard Butler stealing the show. It's a well deserved 9/10 from me.",9/10
Plane (2023),"Plane is a good action film filled with intense acting, gunshots, fights, and story. The story goes along with Captain Brodie Torrance (Gerard Butler) flying his crew and passengers on an airplane with an dangerous criminal, Louis Gaspare (Mike Colter) on board. When they fly into international waters that everything does not go according to plan. A violent storm strikes the plane causing them to land in a remote island somewhere in the Philippines filled with armed rebels. Brodie Torrance, Gaspare, and the military must rescue and escape with the crew and passengers before everything goes wrong. Overall, I liked it for what it is that a plane crash goes wrong and has to rescue everyone safely from the rebels. Also, Gerard Butler does not miss with his action films in this one. It is a good watch in theaters for a good action start in 2023.",7/10
Plane (2023),"If you can ignore all the nonsense and absurd, close your eyes and make the world a little blurred, suspend belief (almost all), accept in full, do not hesitate to mull, take your reasoning, then make sure it's transferred. To be fair, there's not a lot of film left once you've done that.Gerard Butler doing what GB does best, in a story with plenty of mind numbingly repetitive and nonsensical violence, enveloped around a ridiculous scenario, with casualties and cadavers aplenty, which is fine, because you've seen it so many times before, and all that changes each time is the accent which, on this occasion, wasn't as Scottish as it could have been.",4/10
Plane (2023),"Of course I opted to sit down and watch the 2023 action thriller ""Plane"", as I had the opportunity to do so, since Gerard Butler movies tend to be enjoyable.Writers Charles Cumming and J. P. Davis put together an entertaining script and storyline for the movie. And it was one that offered action-packed thrills right from the very beginning. Actually the movie kicks into high gear very early on and never slows down. And that, in my book, definitely makes for some good old fashioned action entertainment.The acting performances in the movie were good, and while it could certainly be said that this is an archetypical Gerard Butler movie, it still makes for some pretty good entertainment. I was genuinely entertained from beginning to end.Aside from Gerard Butler, then the movie also had good performances from the likes of Mike Colter, Tony Goldwyn, Yoson An and Paul Ben-Victor. So there were some familiar faces on the cast list.The action sequences in the movie were well-choreographed and executed on the screen, and that definitely added a lot of enjoyment to the movie.If you enjoy Gerard Butler movies then you will most certainly also enjoy ""Plane"".My rating of director Jean-François Richet's 2023 action thriller ""Plane"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",6/10
Plane (2023),"Some movies are meant to have a simple fun time with. No need to try to be more than what they are. Inaccuracies can be ignored since this movie wears its identity on its sleeve. It's the inaccuracies and straight to the point filmmaking that tells the audience that you're in for a good time. Don't take it too seriously.The movie treads familiar territory, although it still feels fresh. The script does a fine job of staying mostly ahead of the viewer. You know generally what to expect, but the plot points that get us to the climax are handled well by not over explaining what's going on. The real life missing flight MH370 is an obvious inspiration for this film (it even name drops the missing plane in the movie). The plane itself is a driving force in the movie's narrative and supports the simple title of Plane. Our pilot hero is the most fresh part of the movie. He is set up as being physically capable of doing what he does, but is also more vulnerable than most action lead's.The pace is almost non-stop, action is easy to follow, and the movie surprisingly does have some heart in the end, which is helped by some fine acting. Expect to have a lot of fun with this, as long as you are willing to forgive the goofs and looseness of the plot. It's worth a theater watch or at least to watch with a group of friends!",8/10
Plane (2023),"""Plane""; that's one of the laziest, blandest titles imaginable; I wonder if they were even serious when making the film!The final outcome suggests otherwise.It's one of the most contrived, chaotic (in a bad way) aviation/hostage thrillers I have ever seen. To say the writing is sub-par would just be an understatement.Everything happens all too easily. First, they smoothly crash landed, then the passengers were taken hostage & subsequently got freed with little to no effort. Shortly after the plane took off from the island and went to a nearby landing strip and saves the day (again all too easily) Leaving the audience with no scope to gauge the stakes.Although there were moments in the plot that were supposed to instil feelings of anxiety and dread, but nothing left a lasting impression due to its poor writing & a lazy, ineffective set-up. Even the actors (with paper thin scripts to work with) were incapable of salvaging anything of significance. Now the action isn't half bad, but when you have got nothing else backing it up, plans are bound to come crashing down (pun intended).",4/10
Plane (2023),"""Plane"" is such a lackluster movie with so many parts that seem...missing. You get the sense that there is a more flushed out movie here IF it was shuffled around differently. And that makes for a very frustrating viewing. The trailer pitch seemed to be a these two men on the poster who team to take on baddies. In reality, they spend a small window of time together, but more importantly don't have moments to breathe. A simple solution would be to clue us in on more of the criminal. Yes, much was given away in the trailer. He isn't a bad man. But what we discover as watching is...he isn't even a tough guy at all. Which makes it quite odd to watch him dispatch Filipino separtists (something they mention more times than you care to know). I think it was a mashing of a few cinema tropes. For instance, when the plane does go down, they cut away to the headquarters of Trailblazer Airlines which attempts to do damage control. This is taken from something like ""Under Siege"" or ""Air Force One"". If they were to steal from this, why not make Gerard Butler's character much more...deep. Instead, he isn't made to be very interesting. At some points I found myself asking ""What would Liam Neeson do here?"" Yeah, it falls under that category.So little time is spent on anyone. Or should I say quality time, that even the baddies don't seem that menacing. In fact, they seem sort of...blase about the entire occurrence. Silly as it seems, a local townsperson from a neighboring town actually alerts these jungle warriors into action. And we get a quick idea of their dirty deeds. Which seems so tiresome. This movie is really anemic to what could've made this a solid action flick. Like in when Rambo wrecked revenge on the Burmese militants. That was fun.Here, even Gerard's partner seemed so middling. He even seemed more the speed bump then the man attempting to make himself a good guy. Honestly, I half expected him to sacrifice himself to save the passengers and Gerard would say something clever. Nope. That would elevate this pic into something more fun.It seemed like they just made a very safe film. No heavy lifting. No real stakes. It just is.Now for those who want to see what happens pre-flight, they spend ample time at the beginning of this movie showing all that. To my impatience, I endured it with no reward.I will give them credit. WHEN the first deaths occur, the flight attendant Bonnie (Daniella Pineda) does not wig out. She remains stoic and steely. Something never shown in movies. A woman who doesn't go into hysterics. Chalk it up to trauma or training, I was surprised they chose this route. While refreshing, it would've also been nice to show all the pent up tension release. That would cause the tears to flow. Because she just saw people die. That's been getting on my nerves lately. The fact that this entire flight suffered horrific trauma gave no indication having survived a crash, and then fellow passengers murdered, that they all start cheering when all is well. Man, does that get on my nerves.People should be in shock. If anything, the placement of the merc soldier who says ""You're quite a pilot"" should happen as he steps off the plane and sits on the stairs. There is zero set up and absolutely no payoff.Incidentally, as far as movies that are shot digitally these days, this has to be one of the worst. Brendan Galvin is typically a solid cameraman. I surprised to see how video this looked. But again, I doubt he put up much of a fight when it came to getting this project done. He must've chose the less cumbersome path. And collected a simple payday. Which is something I extend to everyone involved.Yes, it feels like a straight to vid flick. Which, that said, isn't the worst of the ones in the bin.",5/10
Plane (2023),"INCREASINGLY LUDICROUS FODDERAs a comicbook action/horror film this does what it should, and keeps the viewers attention for a couple of hours. They will have to disengage all common sense , technical knowledge and ignore the feasibility of the events unfolding before their eyes, but it is possible- as other reviews here testify.You may need to use ear buds to nullify the crashing soundtrack, capable of inducing blindness at loud volume, while G. Butler manages to do his slurred whisper delivery at a level requiring subtitles.The film is well produced, decently directed, reasonably well acted etc, it just hasn't got a good script or characters. They're just cartoon stereotypes, which isn't a bad or unexpected thing in action films, its just not used to better effect as you find in the best B-MOVIES... and despite whatever budget & calibre of actors this film has it is absolutely a B-MOVIE. A modern US version of Italian made ' Savages in the Jungle / cannibal /zombie' classics . Though no zombies are in this, and they sadly dont have to resort to cannibalism like in the 'based of a true event' film ALIVE.It's also a horror film due to the terrible things that transpire to the passengers.I won't give anything away about the predictable story, but the utter horror of the events is totally ignored at the finale, and only 'great gratitude' remains, it is possibly the most un-nerving event in the entire film !The subtext of the film is more interesting than the film itself.I won't bore anyone with a full analysis - the basics are common themes of many horror films and include-1- Fear of flying - Aircraft travel
2- Fear of Lightning /Nature
3- Fear of non-'westernized' societies.4- Fear of travel to places not westernised
5- Trust & Reliance on authority figures
6- Failure of technology, Yet, also its resurrection via Human ingenuity.7- Errors by service personnel/administrators leading to life threatening situations.All of which just happen to coincide with notable changes in society at the moment, which I dont need to elaborate upon here.There's probably more groans of disbelief or cries of cheese in this film than any intended laughs.It really lands in the middle of the road, among a jungle of cliches.",5/10

The unbelievable fact of a prisoner suddenly being added to the flight with only one person to guard them. The plane losing all ability to fly due to a lightening strike. A crash in a jungle......
Honestly if you take the ten main plot points of the movie and read them out in random it doesn't even sound like the sort of movie that would get made.Nobodies acting is good. The script is terrible, the premise is a joke.It's hard to believe that movies have dropped in quality so much over the last couple of years.Dismissed.",2/10
Plane (2023),"An FBI agent escorting a murderer who's an ex military, traveling on a plane. In the middle of the Pacific the plane is about to crash due severe weather and mechanical problems. In the worst part of the about-to-crash situation the FBI agent has his cellphone in a hand (Why?). Due the to bumps, the phone drops to the plane floor.A normal personal would hold, wait and keep safe, ignoring the phone, knowing you're not only responsible for your life but for others since you're ESCORTING A MURDERER.But in this movie, the FBI agents removes his seatbelt and goes, against everyone's advice, looking for his phone. A phone that won't do any good since YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PACIFIC anyhow.What happens next is that the FBI agent is killed after a serious plane's bump. Also a steward is killed trying to sit the FBI agent down.The perfect scene for an audience that spends more time looking at their phones than real life around them. Without a question, that audience will find this scene very relatable.This scene defines the entire movie: All situations in this movie follow that same logic with the adding of drug cartels, a drunk hero pilot who badly needs to shave, annoying passengers who complaint because nobody rescues them in 30 minutes, a low cost airplane company hiring expensive mercenaries, and a long and sad etc.Movie could've been good, but they took it so many steps down so the young (and low IQ) audiences could follow the plot.Steven Seagal's movies are more realistic than this.

""Plane"" does not offer anything new, a recycled script full of clichés and predictable scenes, it only becomes interesting during the first minutes in terms of the plane sequences that are reminiscent of disaster genre movies. The performances do their job without any additional merit, plus the director's work seems barely to exist. The cinematography is conventional without any appeal. The soundtrack goes completely unnoticed. The action scenes are bland and in some scenes the digital effects are quite unreal. A bad movie that fails to take off.",3/10
Plane (2023),"Butler is part of a generations of action heroes, perhaps a bit long in the tooth now, who simply do not know how to give a weak performance. There is nothing new about the story, but the pacing is interesting. The director could have turned this into a race, a mistake too many actioners make, trying to constantly hype the audience with new thrills. Instead, the whole film is done more slowly, which in this cases makes the story feel that much more personal. A half hour into it, not a lot has happened but the audience starts to feel like they too are on that plane... and wish they were not. Overall a perfect film to keep you entertained for an overseas flight ... unless of course you have an overactive imagination. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

It's a well paced movie, roughly broken into 3 acts. But, for me, it's a surprisingly short movie. Just a little over an hour and half. I actually wished there were another 30 minutes to really flesh out the story and the characters, plus adding even more action. Gerard Butler is his usual solid, tough guy self and the addition of of Mike Colter (Luke Cage!) make the movie a really solid action duo. It's a light movie, but doesn't pretend to be something that its not. So, just sit back and enjoy the flight.",8/10
Aftersun (2022),"Oof, this movie hurt.""Aftersun"" is a slow build to a climax that left me openly weeping, to the point that I had to sit in the theater for a bit after the end credits were over just to compose myself.It doesn't even seem to be about very much for a while, just a melancholy story about a dad and his pre-teen daughter trying to enjoy a vacation at a run-down resort. But man, that ending comes along and wallops you, and you realize all at once that the movie is about so much, and that's it's been gradually revealing its layers to you all along.I seriously can't even think about this movie without tearing up. I think about that ending, about how the dad just wants to give his daughter a fun vacation while sinking into a black hole of depression, and the daughter, too young to fully understand the depths of her dad's despair wanting as an adult to go back in time and help him, and I want to bawl.Easily one of the best movies I saw this year. If movie awards were to be taken at all seriously, this film would be nominated all over the place.Grade: A+",10/10
Aftersun (2022),"You have a video of a holiday in the past, when you were young, before life's burdens had amassed, with a father you adore, likes to take to the dancefloor, though he's generally withdrawn and quite downcast. A reflection of a time when eyes were new, interpretation was a seed, as yet to grow, but when you look back now, it's a different world somehow, revealing spaces not yet entered, or sought to go.It's a slow meander, beautifully filmed, with two incredible performances, although those two highlights alone don't create a piece that takes your breath away as much as you might like, until you sit down to reflect, and absorb what you've seen through your own eyes.",8/10
Aftersun (2022),"Aftersun is a film that I wasn't sure I understood when the credits started rolling. Then, as I sat and thought about everything I had seen, I came to believe more and more that it's kind of genius.What the movie lacks in overt substantive plot it more than makes up for in authenticity and subtle placement of character-building images and dialogue. In the moment, these often feel like tangents and the overall picture isn't clear.While it can make for a frustrating first viewing, the clarity that comes with the film's final shot suddenly puts everything into perspective and I felt an overwhelming flood of emotion for the two central characters.Suffering happen more often than not in silence, and it's the cumulative of this film's many quiet moments that drive home one of the most effective, nuanced messages of compassion that I've seen all year.This is a masterpiece of subtlety, arguably slightly to a fault, but it's refreshing to see it in the age of ""hammer over the head"" messaging in movies that we're currently living in.",9/10
Aftersun (2022),"It's been years since posting here and never before for a reason that entails major spoilers, so this is a serious alert: If you haven't seen the film and don't want major spoilers, wait til you've seen the film to read this. I myself went into this film, as i typically do, knowing nothing of what to expect (reading no reviews) and that surely accounts for much of the unprecedented degree of ""fog"" throughout my viewing (although the terrible audio we had, missing lots of dialogue, was also part of the fog), such that as we left the theater, baffled, i couldn't have imagined giving it an ""8"" or even writing here, but that's where the ""landmines"" come in ... After getting home, reading many critics' reviews, I began to see the film through such new eyes that i suddenly made sense of its plotline and meaning that went way beyond what any critic was saying. I just finished every 'user review' here too and it has persuaded me to write this because i don't see anyone interpreting it in the way I'm here to propose:I now believe that adult Sophie is (re)watching the camcorder that she has kept for 20 years with this one life-puzzle tape in it and now watches it (yet again?) with added poignancy and purpose for her now being the age her father was then. I believe she has probably rewatched this film many times searching for clues in her father that she didn't fully comprehend at the time. ""Aftersun"" may allude to a metaphorical ""sunburn"" she was left with from that trip and is forever dogged by.While for Sophie that trip meant reconnecting with a dad she loves and misses (wishing at the end that they could stay on together in hotels forever) and, despite all her hesitant inquisitiveness seeking to know dad better and how he sees the world, she had not at all perceived the ultimate purpose of the trip for her dad. In retrospect, he telegraphed the purpose of the trip for him in ways we viewers in the moment also didn't fully ""get"" as to their ""landmine"" potential: Especially when he teaches Sophie how to defend herself physically, to hold up her arms just right, etc., he becomes agitated that she isn't taking it as seriously as he wishes and urges upon her just how important this learning is. (Only he knows that he won't have future opportunities to teach her these things.) In other scenes, he's relaying life lessons about being true to herself, etc. For me the landmine only 'exploded' an hour after the film - to realize that Dad knew this was how he'd chosen to spend his last days, doing all he could think of to leave life lessons and self-protections for his beloved daughter's future life.We don't know what oppresses and depresses her father - and I believe two key scenes are in reverse-chronology (plausibly as adult Sophie's memory evokes them in that order): we see him enter the ocean and never return before we see him sobbing naked on the edge of the bed. (Of course, neither of those scenes can be from her watching the camcorder tape, i.e., they couldn't have been taped, but instead are either from adult Sophie's imagined scenes as to how some of her father's actions played out after she boarded the plane or from just the third-person narration stance that the film did often incorporate.) I believe a reason we'd seen dad fall asleep naked on the bed previously was background to give context when he sits naked and sobbing - and he's alone in the room. This is the truth of what happened after he left the airport through the double doors. He had planned this exodus but it filled him with grief nonetheless - a grief he'd been carrying since childhood when parents didn't remember his birthday(s) and he felt unimportant, untreasured, unloved - which would have given every reason for lifelong depression but we also could have been seeing a dad who was confronted, say, with a terminal illness or other reason besides ""simply"" depression. For whatever reason, I believe he bought the rug knowing it would be a tactile connection to him that he would be leaving for her (in his personal effects that would be sent to her). I believe he drank more at the end because as her departure grew close so did his intended plan to let the ocean take him away and he was drowning his sadness at leaving his daughter's world as he'd already decided to do. I think doing karaoke with her again was perhaps just too wrenching now that it was the eve of their final time together.I also believe that his saying ""I love you"" to Sophie's mom, that made her confused and curious could well have happened if, say, their marriage had ended because of his depression but there was still caring and love.I believe all this 'emotional history' of her two parents that she gets random clues about during that trip have become core pieces of a puzzle of who Sophie is to herself and yet adult Sophie still looks at the camcorder for more clues about what she might have missed in her father's words and actions during that trip.I think the 'disco shards' of memory that intervene in the film at times are adult Sophie's ongoing bombardments of puzzle pieces about her heritage - her parents' relationship that brought her into existence and what they were like ... given that at least one parent was capable of sheltering her from the full truth of his (suicidal) intentions.I myself find all these thoughts to be in the realm of over-interpretation, and I lay them out here partly as my own reality-check whether anyone else did see or could see the plotline and message in this way? Since none of the dozens of reviews I read tonight broached any of these readings of the film except for one commenter here who, almost as an aside, thought Sophie's dad at the end either a) went for cigarettes and disappeared or b) committed suicide, which the commenter sort of dismissed with an ""eek.""My own view entails no ""eek."" And if anything, especially reading all kinds of reviews that used the word 'vulnerability' to describe what her father seemed uncomfortable with. That made me think of Brené Brown's work (on the power of vulnerability - if you're not familiar google that on TED talks and join the 60+ million people who've watched her talk; many a suicide results from the shame of vulnerability) and how one possible message in this film could be a kind of outcry from an abandoned daughter, 20 years later, wishing her father - as she keeps rewatching him on the 'eve' of his suicide - might have not despaired to the point of ending his life because of shame or a sense of failure that may have undergirded his depression. And indeed some of young Sophie's questions of her dad on that trip can be seen as her probing to understand her dad's inner radar and (painful) life experience and learning.Please forgive my excesses of verbiage here or of what may seem off-the-wall over-interpretations. I write them largely to elicit whatever connection any reader might make and share to any of these notions of the film's message. Thanks.",8/10
Aftersun (2022),"Like the very best art, writer/director Charlotte Wells's film MUST be seen more than once to be appreciated, fully felt and understood. Like the fragmented family it depicts, the film requires of its viewer connection, engagement, commitment.For example, on first viewing one wouldn't know the dark-haired woman dancing is the the adult Sophie, whose memories of a holiday with her father 22 years earlier make up the narrative. That dance montage recurs several times and at the end. On the last night of the Turkish holiday young Sophie declines her dad Colum's invitation to dance, but we see her adult version dancing and then the girl herself. Charactreristically, even when he's dancing with them he is dancing alone.The ending winds back to the beginning too. The film opens with Sophie filming a playful interview with her father two days after his birthday. That scene repeats later. At their airport parting Colum films young Sophie's playful ducking, posing and wide-grinned wave. A still of that grin freezes as a wall blow-up, from which Wells pans through the adult Sophie's flat, showing the pensive woman on her own birthday. That pan continues back to our (and Sophie's) last view of Colum, pausing his camera, walking back, down a hall and disappearing behind distant doors. The last-shot doors define hie absence.Like that last long pan through three sets, the film constantly plays with time. Instead of a throughway narrative we get the discontinuity of experiences remembered, shuffled, re-examined. The memory muddle explains the frequent asynchronicity, where the sound and image are at odds. We hear Colum on the phone in one position while we see him in quite another, tucking Sophie into bed. Sometimes he wears his cast, sometimes he doesn't.The key ambiguity is the shot of Colum walking fully-dressed into the night sea. It's an explicit suicide out of A Star is Born. In the next scene he's back in the hotel room. In a linear ploy he would have returned from the shore. But in a narrative that makes jumble and uncertainty its key principle that scene suggests his suicide. Not within that narrative period, but at some point, leaving adult Sophie searching her memories to deal with it.The film's central irony is that in this rare extended visit the young girl proves to have the poise, character and maturity of an adult, while her father reveals the weak, troubled helplessness of a child. Frankie Corio's performance of Sophie is miraculous. Her every look suggests a profound complexity of feeling. Freeze a frame and read. When she's locked out of their hotel room Sophie coolly sleeps in the lobby, then tries to assuage Colum's guilt. When she covers her father's naked body on her bed she's the adult tucking in the kid.Sophie is unruffled by overhearing two young girls discussing their sexual activity, the sexual play of the teens she meets over a pool game, the teens' later heavy drinking, even her spotting two gay men kissing in a doorway. The latter may shade Colum's ""new thing going with Keith."" Matter-of-factly, she tells Colum of her having kissed young Michael.When Colum tells her that as she grows up she should feel free to tell him anything, the shot has them on a small float in the distance, against a wide expanse of water, hills in the background. The scale conveys the futility of Colum's promise, his helplessness to support her.In an early shot we hear Sophie's steady breathing, asleep in the foreground, while on the balcony behind Colum labours through tai chi exercises - while smoking! The deeply troubled Colum is reading about meditation and tai chi. He's at loose ends, between girlfriends and jobs. Through Sophie's description of her fatigue the camera shifts to show his face registering a far more profound exhaustion.He is also in money trouble. Just before we see Sophie gifted an All-Inclusive resort bracelet, Colum picks up a cigarette butt to smoke. He overreacts to Sophie's loss of a swimming mask. He complains that the hotel room provides less than he paid for. He and Sophie skip out on a restaurant bill. In a rare impatience she asks him why he keeps promising things (i.e., singing lessons) that he knows he can't afford. His purchase of an expensive carpet seems to deny that - but he buys it in a spirit of gloom, not joy. We're glad to see it in the adult Sophie's flat.Over Colum's unseen heavy breathing we see the adult Sophie rise from bed, then assure her woman partner that she'll tend to their crying baby son. A blurry montage of Colum leads to his wakeup call for the day trip that celebrates his birthday. Young Sophie enlists the tourist strangers to serenade him. Cut from that ""jolly good fellow"" to Colum sobbing helplessly, naked, alone in a dark room.At their last supper Colum pays for a polaroid snap of them together. While Sophie wistfully wishes they could stay at the resort forever we watch the photo slowly developing, firming up to clarity, a miniature of the slowly revealing montages we have been absorbing.And so to the title. My (wise) wife Anne suggests Aftersun sounds like a catchy name for a sunguard lotion, something to treat burns. We see Colum applying protective balm to Sophie a few times. Her cascade of memories are an attempt to salve that emotional sear. Aftersun also seems an inflection of Afternoon, the halfway division of the day so by extension a pivotal point in Sophie's complicated memories of her dad.",10/10
Aftersun (2022),"I almost never watch films twice but 'Aftersun' was a rare case where I absolutely had to. I don't think this film can be fully appreciated on first watch. I saw someone suggest that after you watch it your mind will go back to little moments and re-evaluate their significance, and it will. But watching it again with the full picture gives the entire movie a different perspective. The second watch is almost like watching a different film.Kids in films, particularly in lead roles, can often be very annoying. That isn't an issue here. Frankie Corio gives one of the most likeable child performances I can ever remember seeing. Her chemistry with Paul Mescal was amazing. I read that she wasn't privy to Mescal's solo scene rehearsals, so that she wasn't fully aware of what his character was going through, much the same as her character Sophie wasn't. That's brilliant.Something that was very apparent on second viewing was the significance of the music in the movie. The first time through I remember thinking, ""there are a lot of good songs in this movie"". On second viewing you realise that every song used is telling a story. It's telling you what is going on, but like most people in the real world, we just hear a banging song and nod our head to it. Then later on we reconsider its true meaning.Finally, this film has one of the beast movie endings I can remember seeing. It's classy, heavy and thoughtful all at once. It's done in a beautiful and somewhat haunting way that will stick with me for a long time. 9.5/10.",9/10
Aftersun (2022),"I am only writing this review so I can remember later on why I only gave this movie a 6. I understand that this movie has an extremely powerful and intimate presentation of the relationship between a reckless father and his young daughter. I noticed the intricacies and nuance that the film makers tried to convey throughout. I just did not connect with the film at all. I imagine that this film hit some people hard but for me I was quite bored with it by the end. I have to simply be true to my own feelings and opinions from a film and conclude that to me, it is simply ok. Don't take my rating too seriously because I can genuinely imagine somebody else watching this film thinking that it is the best thing they ever saw.",6/10
Aftersun (2022),"A moving film about a girl reminiscing on a holiday to Turkey taken with her estranged father 20 years prior. The use of music is terrific, the two central performances are very touchingly delivered (Paul Mescal and the young Frankie Corio). It is one of the films of 2022. The fact this is Charlotte Wells' debut feature is nothing more than astonishing. She delivers massive assurance and confidence in direction, which pushes the narrative forward very tenderly as the girl (Sophie) tries to reconcile her relationship with her father Callum in two separate timelines.Along the way we are given snippets of her father's troubles. Wells' very cleverly weaves in a subtext that works to a crescendo in the last 10 minutes which includes one of the most brilliant transition shots in recent cinema (not hyperbole, it really is brilliant). The viewer is invited to join the dots on what has happened between the two timelines and there are several clues that help.Wells' debut has a familiarity with the work of fellow Scottish director Lynne Ramsay, and in particular her film 'Morvern Callar'. This feels lie the birth of another great director.",9/10
Aftersun (2022),"After watching this beautiful film and coming across a little note from the amazing storyteller Charlotte Wells:(I cannot share URL apparently so please search ""A note from Charlotte Wells from the site of A24."")This was the word that broke me down. Hasret.I just couldn't resist my tears. As a Turkish person, its just both amazing and heartbreaking from the point of view of the director that this word resonates with her feelings from a place she had this holiday with her late father. That it stuck with her...Even though it is not the same case at all, I remember the times as a kid I closed the door on my dad because he would come home late from work. That because he would promise me to come home early.Now, today I can't even imagine how saddening it was for him at those times and it wasn't even at his hands.Hopefully I will be able to share my love and gratitude my parents as Charlotte did here with such elegance through some way. Since, it's not easy to recapture feeling this instant or in any...Thank you for this film all in all, it surely made me reconsider a lot recently...",9/10
Aftersun (2022),"Aftersun is one of the most oddly touching and unique films of the year. The acting from the two leads was phenomenal. The cinematography and color palette was gorgeous. This is a very impressive directorial debut. As children, we don't know much of anything. It isn't until later in life when it hits us. That realization of finally understanding what you never understood for so long. Aftersun depicts this idea so perfectly. It is told through a woman remembering a vacation with her father, and how she realizes that she never really knew him. Depression is not always obvious. Just because everything looks okay on the outside doesn't mean everything is okay on the inside.",9/10
Aftersun (2022),"I'm always happy when I see debut feature's from new filmmakers, Charlotte Wells is the newest addition to that list. After Lynne Ramsay and Ruth Paxton, here we have another brilliant Scottish Filmmaker with her feature debut ""Aftersun"" produced by Barry Jenkins and Adele Romanski. The story revolves around Sophie and her father Calum, a divorcee who must care for his minor daughter while coping with loneliness and mental health.The film opens with a handy cam footage of Calum where at first glance seems almost happy, until he is posed to answer a question by Sophie. The frame is paused, followed by glitches from the footage as we follow in flashback. Eleven-year-old Sophie vacationing with her dad. It is full of light, happy moments they shared between each other but it always fades into bitterness till the last goodbye.Don't think this is is yet another traumatic arthouse film with ambiguous narrative that drags out and goes nowhere. I promise you that this plot is smart, will immerse you avidly, sometimes choking on what is happening on the screen. Because it is very difficult to resist drawing parallels with real life. Some might feel this is a personal story or the life story of your friends is woven into the film.Firstly, the issues raised in the film like the coming-of-age, loneliness are not blown out of proportion or doesn't scream too loud. Even with the chic and sophisticated staging, filters the father-daughter relationship doesn't fall into the stereotypes. The bond between both is shot so beautifully unlike Hollywood directors who strongly exaggerate. On the one hand, i love how the director uses the location to reveal the characters, exposing the emptiness and with famous musical accompanies as background score.Secondly, kudos for Charlotte Wells as she cleverly registers emotions though it is never explained in dialogues. In fact, very little is explained in this atmospheric film. I loved the staging of a particular scene, Sophie takes a small glance through the keyhole as she watches girl ""hand job"" gesture while she brags about it with her friends. So many things would have gone wrong here but i appreciate Wells for drawing a line and keeping things delicate throughout the runtime.Coming to the performances, Paul Mescal is capable of transmitting tenacity and great fragility in the same shot as he stares into the abyss and the internal conflicts that lie dormant deep within him (the dance scene). He gives his best to hold the viewer in an atmosphere of melancholy and empathy. There are times when he does his best as a Father and especially the bare back shot of him sobbing is brilliant without excessive melodrama as the scene cuts to a letter he had written to Sophie.Frankie Corio is magnificent in her first acting debut as a 11-year-old, it seems like this was the role she was destined to play, a tailored made character. She is not too matured, whimsical or cute with dramatic intensity but does strike a balance with emotions and inhabits the typical 11- year-old mentality with lot of curiosity (liked how director used the Hookah pot instead of dumb question to register innocence). She hangs out with Michael, they don't introduce in the first meeting, it happens the second time. For me this ranks in the list of my favourite Child performances along with Stanislaw Rózewicz's Birth Certificate (1961), Shinji Sômai's Moving (1993), Dorota Kedzierzawska's Crows (1994), Patricio Kaulen's A Long Journey (1967), Kjell Grede's Hugo and Josephine (1967), Amir Naderi's The Runner (1984), Mariana Rondón's Bad Hair (2013), Yared Zeleke's Lamb (2015), Achero Mañas's El Bola

To those who love slow burn drama, be prepared to sail along to the Sunny side of Turkey as Wells paints a portrait of life, Mental illness and Fatherhood, to say the least, centered on a arthouse narrative. I guarantee that this film's sensitivity and making will strike you at heart with the symmetry of its two protagonists alone .",8/10
Aftersun (2022),"I am... actually speechless. And not because I cried, but because I don't know what to feel. I have a lot of thoughts after watching this movie, but I don't know how to grasp them. It's a very strange feeling I have witnessed only from a few movies I've watched in my life, and it isn't necessarily a bad feeling, but I'm just confused. A lot of things here are absolutely outstanding - the direction, the bond between the two main characters, and the screenplay. All this is great, I was entertained - in a very strange way. I maybe need a rewatch, I have to be older to fully appreciate the movie, but from the first watch, I'm more confused than pleased. But I would recommend watching it nonetheless, it's a beautiful piece of cinema for sure.",10/10
Aftersun (2022),"A teenage girl (Sophie) and her father (Calum) journey to a seaside resort in Turkey for a brief but momentous vacation. Since her parents are separated and she lives with her mother, Sophie rarely gets such an opportunity to spend time with her dad. As they swim and snorkel together, share meals and a room, and talk about important things in life, the two begin to truly bond. Happy and cherished memories are formed, yet problems such as depression, alcoholism, and doubt surface as well. Sophie and Calum attempt to ride the waves that lift them up but just as easily take them under.Aftersun is an intimate and moving portrait of a father and daughter relationship that, according to the director who was at this Toronto International Film Festival screening, is loosely based on real people and her own life. The camera work is intentionally unsteady and from the point of view of Sophie. The filming technique is meant to evoke the sensation of Sophie looking back on treasured memories as if they were in a picture show. There are occasional jumps forward in time of adult Sophie reflecting on what these memories mean to her. The personalities of the characters are gradually revealed so the audience has a chance to meditate on who they are.Aftersun is the feature debut for Charlotte Wells. It is deeply personal for her. It first appeared in Cannes. There is a tremendously moving dance sequence that alone is worth watching the entire film. While the mechanics of Aftersun (the acting, images, story construction, etc.) are more than sound, it really rises above the ordinary and is so stirring because of its central themes; how we shape the memories that we hold and the important things we wish to say to those we love but often don't get a chance to say. ""Live wherever you want and be whoever you want,"" Calum tells Sophie. ""You can talk to me about anything.""",7/10
Aftersun (2022),"This film crept up on me. I was worried it was a gimmicky art film (plus at the beginning the dialogue was hard to decipher) but as the film went on I was swept up in it - purely down to Paul Mescal's and Francesca Corio's performances. Achingly beautiful. I was crying without realising and also on the tube home - the tears just kept coming but it was nothing to do with me.Alison Willmore from Vulture at New York Magazine perfectly articulated what I felt :' It's about wanting to reach across time, and to meet a loved one in an impossible space where, for once, you're both on the same level, and you can finally understand them for who they are - or who they were.'",10/10
Aftersun (2022),"While Aftersun doesn't necessarily dive deep into the main subject matter, I think this works in its favour.Delicately unravelling the story of the two characters as they spend a holiday together in the 1990. Scene by scene, we are given clues into Calum's mental health, and how he's subsequently battling with depression.What really makes this special is that it primarily plays out from the perspective of Sophie, his daughter. With a child's mind, it's harder to notice the emotional triggers and mood changes, which would be a red flag to any adult.While this film is definitely a slow burner, it works perfectly in this case. We are simply watching a father and daughter enjoy a seemingly normal holiday. Over time we see sneak peeks into Calum's mind, and how much he's struggling. But he's still trying to give Sophie the best holiday possible. You start to feel a slow tension building throughout the film, which hits (in my opinion) a really heavy ending.For me, in the final scene and following credits, I was left confused initially. But within a few seconds it all started to fall into place. With the final realisation that this was Sophie's last time she spent with her father before he (most likely) commit suicide. She watches back from a (now) adult perspective, and realises what her father was coping with - but was still trying his absolute best to make it special for her.This film wouldn't work if it was filmed in any other way. The slow pace really gives the viewer time to take in everything, as it's the small details that count here. An excellent film with excellent acting and a great soundtrack. Highly recommend.",9/10
Aftersun (2022),"""There's This Feeling, Once You Leave Where You Grew Up, That You Don't Totally Belong There Again""For the past few weeks, I've heard and read a lot about people's reactions to this film, and I have seen nothing but unhindered love and affection. I was worried, and the reason for my worry was not the sea of scepticism that swept through, but the overbearing expectations that slowly grew deep within my conscience. I was doubtful that the film would live up to it, but now that I've seen it, I can say with certainty that it did, and in ways I never assumed.When the movie ended and the credits began to roll, I sat there in silence, at a loss for words and deprived of any sensibility to express how I genuinely felt. Aside from providing insight into a depressed soul and breaking open a portal to a self-loathing person's innermost despair, the most impressive aspect for me is how it made an instant connection, how seamlessly the film put across its message without ever becoming preachy or condescending in its portrayal.The touching relationship between Paul and Frankie (as Calum & Sophie) adds so much to the story's inherent ambitions. For a long time, I forgot they were actors, coming from different backgrounds; it almost felt like I was watching a real-life father and daughter spending some quality time together, reminding me of those good old days when I used to do the same with my father.Perhaps it's the film's simplified depiction of reality or its overwhelming relatability that made me fall in love, and I can't get enough.",9/10
Aftersun (2022),"I cannot remember a time that a film made me cry. I can't even think of this movie without feeling knots in my throat.This is such a heartbreaking portrait of parenthood with depression, specifically the perpetual pursuit of keeping that side of you from your child, for the sake of making lasting memories with them.The little details and layers upon layers to the characters is just spectacular. The performances left me totally speechless. The subtlety and the natural flow of the dialogue and interactions takes a screenwriter with a DEEP understanding of the human condition.It isn't until we get older that we begin to understand the true anxiety and despair of being an adult, being our parents, and that the vision we had of our future selves at 11 years old was totally unrealistic and ridiculous, specifically for those of us whose anxiety and depression reveals itself to us later in life.",10/10
Aftersun (2022),"This film seems pedestrian at first and for a long while into the story. Rather slow and mundane, it requires patience to allow yourself to settle into what might seem laboured and boring in that it's a rather simplistic story about a father and daughter doing the routine stuff we've all done on a package holiday. I'm not surprised some find it odd that the praise is so high for this film and for the acting because there isn't much overt straining of the acting chops here and nothing is addressed directly. I was sceptical until the last 40 mins or so. However, I realised that it is a film which exploits the art of storytelling from that place of reticence we all feel at times, when it's just too overwhelming to say how we're feeling and as a study in depression and regret it turns out to be very poignant and real in the end. Many have said they need to see it again to fully grasp the nuance here but I find that I will remember it for a good while and that is testament to the story and it's accomplished acting and direction, albeit very slight, almost whispers on a hot breeze. So, I'll set out how I understood it here, don't read on if you haven't seen it.His self loathing is revealed when he--mid normal conversation--spits at his own face in the bathroom mirror while maintaining a pretence at normality - talking to his daughter beyond the bathroom door. It was perhaps the first outright confirmation that he was depressed, full of a lack of self-worth and steeped in self beratment - actions which often accompany depression.Earlier, there were signs as he danced in silence on the balcony while smoking that his mental health wasn't great because it was off-kilter, an inappropriate moment to dance in silence, and to dance oddly as if self-comforting, nearly talking to himself, but not quite.The dim strobing scenes of dancing with Sophie as an adult flash glimpses of what she can now see, as an adult and mother, what she couldn't see then, a very serious and somewhat unhinged man, the reality of his state of mind she failed to see as a child. This is contrasted very well with the fond memories of her last holiday with him and there is one moment she recalls when he failed to wake and let her into their shared room, she was locked out, perhaps metaphorically and emotionally but gained access and found him naked on the bed. Perhaps this particular memory is her only clue as to his odd behavior that she recalls, but she sees him here vulnerable at last, perhaps clearly, and she pulls the sheet over his body as if to comfort and protect him while she keeps watch from the balcony.I found the place of his death unclear although I don't think we're meant to know exactly, some believe he stayed in Turkey, however I thought he handed her over at the airport in London (there was a sign marked London Luton) to a Chaperone. There is a non-contemporaneous shot earlier where he walks into the sea at night in Turkey, a clear signal as to his intentions, or perhaps the past when he committed suicide, just not maybe the exact place. This is confusing but doesn't change the sense of loss in this film.There is a palpable feeling of regret and he exhibits lingering love still for his daughter's mother and there's a sense that this is one-sided as alluded to by the daughter. Why say you love her if you're no longer together? There is also the picture of a man who hasn't been able to cope in the world and to succeed, as happens more than we care to dwell on ... the pressure on men to succeed and provide contributing to high rates of suicide in men. This is confirmed when his daughter berates him for offering to pay for singing lessons when she knows he can't pay for them. His shame is evident here.It's easy to just see this film as a mundane telling of a father & daughter on a typical holiday, however if you grasp his inner turmoil form the outset, that knowledge transforms the experience and culminates in a formidable and profoundly sad story of regret and trauma as a daughter, too young at the time to see the subtleties of depression in the man who was the father she loved so much, looking back and suffering, living with the loss and angst so many feel about not noticing that a loved-one was at that awful stage of being about to take their own life, but they didn't notice. There's huge guilt left behind as a consequence.In the end, this film is real cinema and reminds me very much of French cinema. It is accomplished and it is profoundly sad and moving.",8/10
Aftersun (2022),"The one thing you can say about the film Aftersun is that it's not afraid of subtlety. It's human realism at its core dealing with themes such as childhood, fatherhood, responsibility, class, and vulnerability. It's the opposite of dramatic yet it keeps you engaged and glued to the screen through out as you care about the characters despite the simplicity of their day to day interactions. Paul Mescal plays Callum, a young father to an 11 year-old somewhat precocious girl named Sophie. The film in my opinion is about a father who tries his best to maintain a rock like mask to convey strength and stability for his daughter while being emotionally vulnerable underneath. Occasionally throughout the film that mask slips a little bit as Callum struggles to bear the responsibility of being a dad at such a young age and while facing his own personal troubles. At the same time his daughter, getting older and wiser, starts to explore the world of adolescence while on holiday where she also begins to notice her father's vulnerabilities. It's a sensitive film and one that leaves you enthralled and attached to the characters on a deeply human level even if that dramatic colonel doesn't pop the way you might except.",8/10
Aftersun (2022),"It's one thing for a movie to be subtle and nuanced, but it's something else entirely to be enigmatic and cryptic. And, regrettably, the debut feature from writer-director Charlotte Wells delivers more of the latter than the former. This melancholic character study tells the story of a woman (Celia Rowlson-Hall) who looks back 20 years to a vacation that her perky 11-year-old self (Frankie Corio) took with her young and loving but quietly troubled father (Paul Mescal). In doing so, it explores the subjects of memory, parent-child relationships, mental and emotional well-being, and the various senses of loss we all experience over time, topics that the protagonist's youthful counterpart may not have fully understood at the time but that her adult self now does. I wish I could say the same for myself, though; I often felt that I was being tasked to construct a narrative for the picture myself, based, essentially, on merely what was being shown to me, material that frequently comes across as underdeveloped and open to an array of interpretation in terms of both story line and character development. To put it simply, I didn't feel I was given enough substance to work with to accomplish that task, and it often left me feeling wanting, abandoned by the filmmaker, and, ultimately, uninterested. And, to complicate matters further, the film's poor sound quality regularly obscures the characters' dialogue behind their thick Scottish accents, and its often-dark, overly muddled cinematography made some images difficult to decipher at times. What's more, this offering's camera work - aimed at simulating glorified home movies, a fitting approach for telling this story - is packed with innocuous material. Indeed, who really cares about sitting through endless footage of the characters engaging in mundane activities like playing video games, eating ice cream and attempting to sing karaoke? The ""looking back in fondness"" factor in these supposedly touching segments is a little too inane to engender truly heart-tugging feelings, constituting cinematic padding more than anything integral or meaningful to the overall story. Considering all of the advance glowing reactions I had read about this release, I was really looking forward to it going in. Unfortunately, though, I came away from it almost as sad and disappointed as the protagonist herself.",6/10
Aftersun (2022),"Heartbreaking... or a bittersweet reflection of a memorable moment in time? Your choice! There was so much to love about this movie, especially the two protagonists and their loving yet imperfect relationship with one another. After 90 minutes of spending time with them and ""living"" in their experiences in an intimate way, I was very emotionally invested in this father and child. Yet, although hints of an anguished story relentlessly thrummed in the background, the story remained a tightly guarded secret. Reviewers have lauded this, but I felt dropped like a hot potato. Not that I needed back story, a narrative, or a neatly spelled-out denouement. But the repeated, entirely enigmatic ""dream"" sequences (if that's even what they were) and the ""it's-anyone's-guess"" ending left me feeling cheated and wondering why the writer and filmmaker chose to do this.",8/10
Aftersun (2022),"It's a well made film with great acting by both main leads but I was kind of left feeling empty at the end. The story slowly built for two hours then we see the father at a nightclub never to be seen again. Did he die? Did he leave on purpose? Did Sophie actually push him away. We don't know and the writer/director doesn't really show us. The holiday seemed a bit surreal because it was almost too perfect, like all the best moments of summer holidays rolled into one. My upbringing was never so rosy. Why is Sophie now so many years later going through the memories of this holiday? The focus of the film is on the holiday and then also on the reality that a relationship can end. I think we all know this as friends and family come into and often leave our lives over time. I'm not really sure what the film is trying to say. Enjoy the moments while they last? It's not clear. I'd like to rate this film more highly but the ending or lack of one was frustrating more than anything.",7/10
Aftersun (2022),Sophie re-examines a vacation she had with her father some twenty years earlier using a video tape recorded by her father. Calum (Paul Mescal) is the father struggling with personal issues. Sophie (Frankie Corio) is the young girl enjoying her vacation with her father. She is unawares of her father's troubles.Most of this feels like a home movie. It's lacking in exposition. What it really needs is a plot element from the adult Sophie. This movie needs something from her to wrap around the old vacation. The goodness of this movie comes from the performers Mescal and newcomer Frankie Corio. That little girl is really good.,6/10
Aftersun (2022),"Find it hard to understand the almost universal acclaim this film is attracting. It's almost as if I watched a different film. The Guardian have it as their #1 film for 2022. I have to ask, why?, how? Unless I missed all the subtleties, which is possible, nothing happened. I endured this rather than enjoyed it. I don't get the claims that is a wonderful protrayal of father daughter relationships. The reviews smack of elitisim, if you don't rate this film then you just don't get art. The emperors new clothing springs to mind. The Guardian has Cailín Cúin / The Quiet Girl as their #2 film for 2022, it is, in my opinion, a much better film.",3/10
Aftersun (2022),"Greetings again from the darkness. There are two reasons I was excited to see Paul Mescal nominated for a Best Actor Oscar for his performance in this film. First, he deserved it. Secondly, it offers hope that more people will seek out this terrific, albeit heartbreaking, debut feature film from writer-director Charlotte Wells.Calum (Paul Mescal, THE LOST DAUGHTER, 2021) takes his 11-year-old daughter Sophie (Frankie Corio) on a vacation to a resort in Turkey, where they swim and frolic in the sun. Even though she lives with her mother, Sophie and her dad have a close bond. She's a very observant and perceptive girl, which is crucial given that Calum is a loving and caring dad, but he's also displaying some disturbing signs of depression. What's terrific here is that Sophie is smart, but not over-the-top; while Calum is a good dad, but not flawless. In other words, these are two normal people spending time together.There is a sadness to Calum, even though he is patient and charming. He thinks he hides more from Sophie than he actually does. His calm demeanor on the outside is clearly hiding burning emotions that his tai chi can't cover. While Calum is teetering in life, Sophie is teetering between independence and being daddy's girl. She recognizes his anxiety but doesn't yet possess the savvy or experience to know what it means - although she states this gem, ""It's nice that we share the same sky."" What a lovely sentiment.The vacation is set in the 1990's, however the twist served by filmmaker Wells is that adult Sophie (played in glimpses by Celia Rowlson-Hall) is reminiscing some twenty years in the future by re-watching the camcorder tapes from that vacation. She's looking back with a different filter on what she experienced with her dad ... searching for additional insight to the man she so adored. Sophie has visions of watching her dad on the dance floor as ""Under Pressure"" blasts under the strobe lights. This prevents her (or us) from interpreting these as memories of bliss. Rather it's her search for meaning. Charlotte Wells drew inspiration for this story from her own childhood vacation with her dad. This is the first screen appearance for young Frankie Corio, but she perfectly captures the close relationship with dad. As movie lovers, we can only hope this is the start of a special story-telling career for Charlotte Wells, but even if this is her peak, it's a gem few ever match.",8/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"Great trip to the movies 2/2023. Kelsey Grammer and Jonathan Roomie provide the foundation for this very well done film on the Jesus movement. It shows that Christians are not perfect and that life is rough, but that there is an answer to the questions of life.There is a balance of character development when Greg and Cathe become prominent in the telling of the early days of the ""Jesus Revolution"".It is beautifullybfilmed and the soundtrack had some iconic 60s songs that supported the themes being developed -- desperation and the search for truth even when life gets messy.There is so much in this film that those who seek truth will find it.",10/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"Like much of the Christian drama genre, Jesus Revolution suffers from lots of stilted, VERY on-the-nose dialogue that prioritises getting the message across over sounding natural.But unlike most of the Christian drama genre, the film is shockingly well-focused, prioritising it's characters and their stories just as much as it's religious messages that do admittedly preach to the choir.There's a lot of care put into this movie; it's shot and acted with plenty of artistic prowess, and the story is refreshing in how it is purely centred around its flawed human characters as they work on their broken lives, bad habits, and strained relationships.The familial element of religion is what helps them find the purpose they're looking for, and it's refreshing to see a Christian film that really tries to tell a compelling story about fleshed-out characters rather than just peddle a message without a beating heart and visible soul.Although the film is too long-burdened by repetitive scenes that don't add anything new to the story-and the dialogue is often clunky and unintentionally silly, I was impressed with how much this does right when it comes to filmmaking and storytelling. It's infinitely better than most in this subgenre.",7/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"Nostalgic and relevant! Love the way the people are portrayed. This is not just good Christian filmmaking it's just good filmmaking. The people are flawed, real and multi dimensional. The story is well worth watching. And it is a true story. Times were so similar to today. The Holy Spirit is thriving. Even if you are not a Christian, you'll like the film. Young people will be able to see what their grandparents were like. As in the movie, we can still learn from each other and we all need acceptance and love. It's better than the competition this weekend (Cocaine Bear. Really?) Give it a shot you won't be disappointed.",9/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"I was about 5 years too young, on the other side of the country in New York, and under the deceptive influence of the Roman Catholic Church. Glad I could watch this movie and see what I missed.Being a hippie at heart, I enjoyed the nostalgia. What moved me, was how you could see the hand of God through everything. There are no coincidences with God. It showed how God can take the most unlikely, broken people and transform them into messengers of His love, power, and salvation. It's the movement that birthed the Calvary Chapels and Pastor Greg Laurie, who's depicted in the movie.Every church should go see it. I pray that it starts a new Jesus Revolution - we need one NOW!",10/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"Jesus Revolution is a faith-based drama that tells the story of how a group of hippie teenagers in California became part of a nationwide spiritual awakening in the early 1970s. The film focuses on three main characters: Greg Laurie (Joel Courtney), a rebellious youth who finds his purpose and calling as a preacher; Chuck Smith (Kelsey Grammer), a conservative pastor who welcomes the long-haired newcomers into his church; and Lonnie Frisbee (Jonathan Roumie), a charismatic leader who struggles with his own demons.The film has some strong points, such as the authentic recreation of the era, the sincere performances by the cast, and the uplifting message of grace and forgiveness. It also shows how Christianity can be relevant and inclusive to people from different backgrounds and cultures. However, the film also suffers from some weaknesses, such as an uneven pace, a lack of depth and nuance in some characters and themes, and a tendency to gloss over some of the darker aspects of the movement. The film sometimes feels like a disjointed collection of scenes rather than a coherent narrative.Jesus Revolution is not a bad film, but it could have been better. It is a movie that will appeal to fans of faith-based cinema and those who are interested in learning more about this historical phenomenon. But it may not satisfy those who are looking for more complexity and realism in their dramas.",6/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"Absolutely amazing and powerful in every way. The actors were perfectly matched to their characters. Stories were woven and tied together and brought to life. Many moving and emotional scenes.Script was real, period music and wardrobe, and again, absolute perfection in every way.I just hope people will not be turned off before they even see it just because of the title. For us Christians, especially who attend a Calvary Chapel church, to see how it all came together.The movie is so well done, that you can't help but feel the overwhelming power of it and leave feeling much better than when you walked in. We needed this movie to be done and shared on the big screen.",10/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"This is a great movie; I enjoyed it very much.Being a movie nut and all, I have to say that that the production quality was top notch. I saw no glaring continuity problems, the camera work was well done and the ""designs"" were fabulous (costume, scene, etc.). I also think the script was terrific. As one other reviewer noted, the scripts and acting in some ""Christian"" films showing at regular cinemas in recent years has been a bit rough. Not in this movie; it's all great.I was there. In the years 1971 to about 1973, I sat in the front pew (if there were space for me) in that church in Riverside, CA (aka All Saint's Episcopal Church) within 20 feet of Greg Laurie (sometimes being amazing at the length of his beard). I had some of those tracts he designed and I listened to Love Song and many of the other popular bands of the day. I went down with a bunch of kids from the Redlands/Yucaipa of So. CA; we went to our own church services, at various churches, in the morning then we would jump in several cars (yes, one was a VW van) and drive to Riverside for the evening service at All Saint's Episcopal Church with Greg (and the bands, of course). The song book we used (illustrated by Greg), the tracts, the cassette and 8-track tapes for sale, were all Calvary Chapel and Maranatha! Branded. It was a heady time and deserves a place in American religious history.I thought all of the acting was great. I especially loved Kelsey Grammar in the role of Chuck Smith. When, I heard he was going to play Chuck, I let out a loud YES! Of approval. He was an excellent choice. I simply thought that, yes, he could do it. He could pull off Chuck Smith.As the movie began with a very accurate presentation of the time, I expected the movie to continue that way so I was disappointed at parts in the middle and end that seemed to take ""artistic"" license with some of the events, people and locations.The movie avoided some tough stuff; which was probably the right thing to do, maybe leaving it for a future movie or book. I'll avoid specifics not to spoil things for those who have not yet seen the movie but trust me, there was some tough stuff to the movement too.I loved this movie. It took me back. And it adds to the record and the significance of the Jesus Movement in American religious history.",8/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"I was pleasantly surprised by this film; it was a Faith-based Christian film that didn't feel like it was trying to get me to drink the Kool-Aid (and I say this as a devout Christian myself). And although the Christian Faith is central to the film's plot, you absolutely do not need to be a Christian to enjoy it. The movie centers more on how we all are imperfect - broken - and it's up to us to believe in Jesus or not. Great quote from the film: ""Don't be so arrogant that you think God can't work through your mistakes."" That, in a nutshell, is the core meaning of this movie; it's not so much about who Jesus is, but rather, who people are (or can be) with Jesus.",8/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"LIKES:The Pace Is Decent
-These types of movies can be long, drawn out, and quite feeling like a sermon in church
-But this revolution manages to stay closer to the movie pace and make it a movie that actually progresses without getting lost in itself.-It's entertaining, and yet meaningful, and finds this good level that only fluctuates a tad bit near the middle during the transition to the second half of the movie.-And the fact it keeps the story and message strong and doesn't glide over it.... That's pretty impressive for me.Comedy Is Subtle And works
-A movie of this caliber has to tread lightly in the type of humor that comes out of the writing to not be too insulting.-Jesus Revolution accomplishes this with natural dialog, facial expressions, and the just natural delivery of the simple dialogue.-It's spaced well, and timed without being forced and that to me is very good without breaking character and stride.-Maximizes the laughs instead of just throwing darts in hopes of landing a laugh. Did it hit every joke for me? No, but it did accomplish many things.The Acting
-Hands down the acting is so amazing to bring these characters to life and helping sell the message of the movie.-Roumie is more of the star in this film than the others, and he plays this role so well when I go back and reflect on the character of Lonnie.-He's funny, certainly in how he just drops the comedy as an awkward free thinker. On then does he come back and be this deep character with monologues that are incredible. And then finally comes back into another moment that sells the complexity of the character.Cirillo is there and he does a few things for me, but the billed in the IMDB is not something I can say I really remember outside of some simple lines that work and get things going.-Others have far more importance and so many of them accomplish this role of a community coming together with odd experiences that work in some type of harmony.-And then comes Grammer who is just incredible with his role and the chemistry he has with just about all the cast.-The way he makes faces, his monologues, and just his lines, it was enjoyable for me, but only if we had more of him.The Movie Magic Moments That Go Well
-The movie really is about the Holy Spirit and wow does Hollywood know how to bring that magic to life.-It's got this blend of visual arts to maximize the shot, adds a musical twist to help subtly open things up, and then ties this ambience that helps deliver the message.-It gets layers, has this timing and pacing, and uses the magic of writing to really keep things in just the right build up to finish opening things up.-And that power is going to be similar to I Can Only Imagine, those moments where things come together perfectly and unleash a wonderful message that like a good sermon, rocks you to your core.The Humility Of the Movie
-And yet the movie is humble as well. It doesn't get so lost in the message of the movie that it forgets the character aspect.-There are human elements that will help ground you to the message and that relatability is smart for me in this movie and giving you those avatars to go on the journey.-I found this in your face at times, but overall, not quite the sermon issues that these movies sometimes tend to follow.The Soundtrack
-If you read my reviews, you know that I love a good soundtrack, and Jesus Revolution has a great soundtrack.-You will find that the music of the decade is there to help add that feeling of back in the past antics, and the popular songs of the charts get their share of time through the speakers.-Throw In the fact that they also have the double layer of adding an element to the story that is simple, elegant, and just the right pop for things to come.-That use helps add dynamics to the movie and make it fun and get you toe tapping if you are like me, so well done.DISLIKES:The Movie Feels Disconnected At The Start
-I expected a movie that was for the most part connected, flowing, and wholesome, just like I Can Only Imagine Was.-Unfortunately, this tale is two very strong stories that take a while to intertwine and even then still feel a bit disjointed.-This swapping back and forth was annoying, and seeing the momentum start to build up and then get lost to this other phase just didn't quite hit me with the way the world building was done.-Hated the drug and darker focuses of the movie, and though important, sometimes becomes a divergence that either feels out of place or sort of lackluster and had just taken away from the components I was enjoying.-And the component that comes with a linear story and one perspective could have solved a lot, but this fracture dive between two did very little for me.The Plot Seems A Tad Mediocre At Times
-The movie tries to give us these moments that feel like sparks are going to fly, only to then sort of fade out with little of the magic.-Now, I don't know the accuracy of this tale, but you now have this magic seeming out of place when the story elements were working so hard to try to make it feel like a budding story.-Rivals sort of just stopping, these miracle moments that rob the stubbornness away, and even some of the family dynamics are all just sort of fails for me to be honest.-But the magical moments of course will sail the ship across the rough waters though and help mitigate a tad, but for me, this plot was a little rough in execution and needed a little more time to marinate and relax in the water.Kimberly Williams Was A Waste For Me
-A talented actress like her deserves a lot more involvement, cohesive storytelling, and finding a place in the movie outside of conventional tool.-And in this film, she did great with the role assigned to her, not necessarily the best role, but still talented in her darker dredges on the main character's tale.And yet she feels extra, lost to a few moments that have some impact, but don't have the same build up, timing, and planning the others did.-So her talent needed more tweaking in my opinion and I would have focused more on those points compared to what I know she can do.A Tad Preachy And Loses The Flow
-Again, the movie does tread into the preaching the gospel territory and loses that natural flow.-It's less than I expected, but sometimes it really trips up the momentum and left me disappointed that these lines were sort of snuck unto to the playing field.-Still, it's not nearly as bad as those that really stray from story to just be a sermon, so count that as a victoryMore Kelsey Grammar Please
-There is not much more I can say, but I wanted more of the actor like I had expected.-He utilizes a lot of good time, but he just doesn't have the full time and integration that I had expected from the trailer.-That double story mentioned earlier eventually pulls him into both, but the interruption often takes away from hist story leaving us once again kind of stuck and bored until he returned.-And you just want this talented actor to be in as much as you can, at least I did, but again not the case in this film for me.The VERDICT:The Jesus Revolution may be one of the most important films of the year to watch. It's got this great lesson packed with talent to sell it, acting wise a great community to help with bringing this odd levels to life. The pace is entertaining, but mostly balanced and the comedy is used in the right amounts and type to help with reducing the insult and injury Hollywood could easily enjoy. And then add the music and Hollywood magic and you really get that cinematic church experience that hits deep, teaches good lessons, and might just move you like it moved me. It's still got some limitations, primarily the disconnected plot that eventually merges to one, but until then is disjointed and feeling off. Throw in that several plots and characters are kind of dull and simplified, while preachiness comes in to try and overtake the naturally flow and again you are sort of out of luck. Still, the movie is quite an experience that is fun and passionate and something we can all choose to enjoy and learn from if given the chance. From this... I give the movie the scores:Drama: 7.5-8.0
Movie Overall 6.5-7.0.",8/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"Anyone who knows me, knows I really hate most Christian films, as the scripts are horrible, the storyline horrible, the acting horrible. This however, is none of that. This was actually a great movie; objectively speaking.Where I had a problem was that this movie didn't actually share the Gospel that actually started that revival - which I was surprised, given this is based on Greg Laurie's book. I know all about Calvary Chapel, as that was my home church for over a decade. A great, Bible expository teaching, gospel centered church. But you got none of that here. What you got, was essentially the ""American Gospel."" - which is, come to Jesus for your drug addiction, brokenness (broken over what? They never say).Before someone can truly repent and be ""saved"", they must know what they are being saved from. That we are sinners, a target of God's wrath, condemned eternally to hell. God, knowing we can't save ourselves, died in our place and took that wrath upon Himself. We come to Him because we are broken over our sin - that's why we're broken. Sure, Jesus DOES help with drug addictions, or anything else.But before He can do that, we need to have a relationship with Him - which we can't have without first accepting His penal atonement for our sins. Only after our sins are covered can we enter His presence and have a relationship, and find healing for everything else.I was truly surprised this was absent from the film, and they opted for the ""it worked for you, maybe it can work for me"" type gospel, as if Jesus is a free trial, and not the eternal Judge and Savior of your soul. I've been to Greg Laurie's church, read his books, been to his Harvest crusades, and he always shares the true gospel - so why was it absent here?I don't know. I just wish it was present, because so many people may watch this movie. Sure this will point people to Jesus and encourage people to seek the truth, but they won't have clear gospel presentation that can save their soul.",8/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"Ladies and gentlemen, get ready to strap yourselves in and hold on tight, because I'm about to give you the most epic movie review of all time! I'm talking about Jesus Revolution, the movie that will have you jumping out of your seat with excitement and singing ""Hallelujah"" at the top of your lungs.This movie is a cinematic masterpiece that has it all. From the awe-inspiring cinematography to the goosebump-inducing soundtrack, Jesus Revolution is a rollercoaster ride of emotions that will have you laughing, crying, and shouting ""Amen!"" like your life depends on it. It's the kind of movie that leaves a lasting impression, and you'll find yourself thinking about it for days afterwards.But it's not just the technical stuff that sets Jesus Revolution apart from other films. It's the story, folks. This movie tells the tale of a group of hippies who find God in the most unlikely of places. It's like if Woodstock and the Bible had a baby, and that baby was baptized in a river of pure awesomeness.But here's the thing, folks. This movie isn't just about entertainment. It's about changing lives. It's about making a difference in the world. It's about finding the light in the darkness, the hope in the despair, and the laughter in the tears.So grab your friends, grab your family, and grab your pastor, and go see Jesus Revolution. You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll leave the theater feeling like you've been saved.",10/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"Welcome back, Kelsey Grammer!Jesus Revolution is a film worth seeing more than once. The gorgeous visuals were unexpected but prove the talent of cinematographer Akis Konstantakopoulos. He definitely took this film to a higher level than many faith-based movies.Yes, the visuals were great, but Kelsey Grammer blew my socks off! I don't know if it is just that I haven't seen him in a while, but this might be my favorite role for him so far. He brought warmth, uncertainty, openness, and humor to his portrayal of Chuck Smith. His scenes with Ally Ioannides are some of my favorites, perhaps because I love to see positive father/daughter interactions on film.I can't end this without mentioning the beautiful portrayal of Lonnie Frisbee by Jonathan Roumie. He had me in tears more than once. He played a complex man who was both powerful and broken, and he did it with vulnerability and love.",10/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"If a Christian movie with Jesus in the title gets decent reviews, you know that actually means it is an excellent film.We all know many faith based films are well-intentioned but poorly executed, but this movie avoids that pitfall, and it also unexpectedly Kelsey Grammer's best performance of his long career.The movie took seven years to come to the screen but it came at a particularly opportune time, with the public interest in Asbury going viral. And it is the right film for this particular time, as it doesn't settle for mere nostalgia, but it fleshes out the full story of one of the main players of the movement, Greg Laurie.",10/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"This is how you make a Christian movie.This is how you make a movie that makes a person think and feel a certain way when you leave the theater.Like i've said many times, i rate movies by what they are suppose to accomplish and not the other hyped up things that dont matter.This movie hits the nail on the head perfectly (for me anyways). It preaches to ALL audiences saved or not, and makes you think and makes you FEEL what the writer wants to say without hitting you over the head with a bible and losing 99% of the audience.Very well written.Very well acted.Great sound track.Awesome cinematography.Didn't feel intrusive or too 'preachy'It was a little preachy, but not in the same way most christian movies are.I didn't know coming into this that this was also about Greg Laurie and his beginning. It didn't affect anything for me. Actually, it fit perfectly for me.Watch this. You will NOT be disappointed.",9/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"From LOINS-GATE studio comes this latest money-grabber, Jesus Revolution, starring Kasey Grammar and a flock of nobodies. It's directed by some guy whose only claim to fame is directing a lot of these ""inspirational faith-based"" money-making flicks.Sadly, I must warn anyone with an ounce of common sense and/or diabetes to AVOID this film. It's an overdose of cotton candy that will leave normal folks trotting for pot, and may result in permanent incontinence.Here are the film's themes, in order of appearance:Aging is bad.Drugs are bad.Parents are dumb.Pep-rally spirirt is the only real thing in the world.Bathing and shaving are bad.What else do we get?Churches are dying (this is the only observation that's valid)
Rock music will save churches (It didn't, it turned them into carnival megachurches for single hookups)Sadly, those folks who enjoy giving trillions of dollars to faith-based con men will LOVE this film like A Mighty Wind. They will gobble up the sugar and call it manna.For those, like myself, who were actually IN the Jesus Freak movement during the 60s and 70s, this is a painful reminder of just how gullible and naive we were back then, and how we conned ourselves into believing because it made us feel high. (High On Teen Spirit would have been a good title for this film)For younger viewers, don't believe a single second of this silly hogwash. It wasn't like that. It was never like that. It's still not like that.Spend your money on something else.",1/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"I watch a lot of Christian movies, I found this one to be the least cheesy christian movie out there. I appreciated the Humor and the message of repentance and love.I love Calvary Chapel, I enjoyed the constant moving of the story and I never felt it was boring or preachy at parts. I appreciated the realness of the movie and I think anyone regardless of their background can see this movie and enjoy it! I liked that it showed the flaws in everyone and it was a raw movie.I did not give it 10 stars cause there was some historical inaccuracies in the movie itself.Overall I recommend this movie and think it is a wonderful movie!",7/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"What this movie involves is definitely somewhat controversial- mainly letting hippies and drug addicts be a part of the church. Many churches frown on this; it doesn't feel right. But when you stop and think about it, it all makes sense. Afterall, Jesus never rejected anyone, and he said it's not the healthy who need a doctor, but the sick. I don't think churches should permit them to play music for the church service without at least getting to know them first. But there are definitely countless drug addicts and people who are lost that are likely to change if more churches would welcome them. This is an important point that more churches need to consider.The movie is quite dramatic at times. There was one point where I thought they went a little too far in showing people using drugs. One person chokes and almost dies. But it should do a good job at discouraging people from using drugs.We were a little disappointed that the character Lonnie sort of disappears and isn't really seen again. But since it's a true story, I guess that was perhaps necessary. I think they should have shown a few more examples of the hippies/drug addicts being transformed into respectable people, but they pretty much covered the important parts.The timing of this movie was definitely divine in that it came out in the midst of some major revivals. It is something that churches need to see.",9/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"I'm sure the religious extremists will love this movie all because it follows their religion. However, the story is convoluted with too many plots for us to keep track of. Which plot are we supposed to care about exactly? The pastors failing church? The hippie movement? Greg Laurie's drug addiction? His love life? Or maybe the fact his dad left him when he was a kid leaving him with his do nothing mother? This movie throws it all at you and tries to wrap it all together to make it look connected... but fails miserably.The pacing is horrible and really seems exhaustingly drawn out. They could have cut the scenes with Greg Laurie's mom or him when he was younger waiting for his dad... they had 0 effect on the overall plot. Also we are led to believe that the Frisbee character was a charlatan and attention hog (like most preachers, Laurie included) but they never really make it clear.Laurie pushed this as his ""testimony"" but he really wasn't the focus of this movie. Grammar's character was. I also find it ironic that in other interviews Laurie said he had to work to get his first church, but in the movie he was given it by Grammar for free. But seeing as how Laurie is an admitted former druggie, his mind is a little damaged (why else would he buy into christianity?).All in all this movie is your typical bible thumper wet dream. They shove their beliefs down the audiences throat... and of course everyone in the movie buys the message hook line and sinker... which they hope everyone in the audience will do the same. I know Laurie and other religious fundamentalists are hoping for another ""jesus revolution""... but isn't I hope we see an atheist revolution.",3/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"Oh my goodness the audience laughed and clapped and cheered! Kelsey Grammer made a very convincing pastor, AnnaGrace Barlow is beautiful and plays Greg's girlfriend , Joel Courtney is excellent as the troubled protagonist Greg. (Also the actor who played the younger Greg was outstanding in conveying the pain from his screwed up mother) and best of all Jonathan Roumie as the charismatic Lonnie Frisbee- perfection! I cried through much of his performance. Also of note the young woman who played Janette Smith- she was terrific. Two hours was not enough! We were definitely left wanting more. Another star was the Pacific Coast- so awesome and so different from our Atlantic coastline.",10/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"It's more than just a story. You can tell it means more. I remember when I was a kid and movies were just movies. Over the years they've lost their meaning in subliminal messages and focusing more on an agenda than actually telling a good story. This movie makes you truly care about the characters, about what happens and it shows that people can change. Unlike all movies recently where it seems like the actors are being held at gunpoint, you can tell the actors and everything what went into this movie cared about it and it shows. It's one thing to go into a theater to be entertained and another to leave a theater entertained and happy and changed.",10/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"I saw Jesus Revolution, starring Kelsey Grammer-Neighbors 2: Sorority Rising, The Expendables 3; Jonathan Roumie-The Chosen_tv, Saving Lincoln; Joel Courtney-the Kissing Booth movies, Super 8 and Anna Grace Barlow-The Big Leap_tv, The Fosters_tv.This movie is based on a true story about how religion and hippies came together in the late 1960's and early 1970's and started a revolution. Kelsey plays a preacher that has a dwindling congregation in 1968 southern California until his daughter introduces him to Jonathan, a hippie that looks and acts a lot like Jesus. Jonathan brings some of his hippie friends with him and starts filling up Kelsey's church-they alternate preaching duties. Joel and Anna are high school kids that get swept up in the spectacle that the church has become. There are lots of period music to be heard-I remember hearing Jefferson Starship, The Doobie Brothers and The Animals, to name a few. At the end of the movie, they tell you more about the churches and the people involved and their present situations.It's rated PG-13 for drug content involving teens and has a running time of 2 hours.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but if you are interested in the subject matter, it would be a good one to stream.",7/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"This movie demonstrates well, that as flawed as each one of us is, He can and does use us to accomplish what He desires. Trusting Him and faithfully following Him can result in the changing of people's lives and even changing the society around us for the better. Seeking the Truth and finding it in the One who claimed to be the Truth can and will change you if you let it happen. All you need is a love for the Truth which He will give to you if you ask for it. Hanging onto your sins will drag you down into Hell eventually. What good does that do? Take a serious look at this movie and see how God works to reach the lost and maybe it can be a life changing experience for you. One that will fill you with meaning and purpose.",8/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"Kelsey Grammer does an outstanding job portraying Pastor Chuck Smith. There are two storylines. One is the life of Greg Laurie and the other is the growth of Calvary Church with Chuck Smith with the ""hippies"" in the 1970s.Growing up in Orange County, California, it was fun to see scenes shot on location at Pirate's Cove in Corona Del Mar and the Balboa Island ""Fun Zone"" in Newport Beach.We are facing many of the same culture and church issues in 2023, but in a different way.This movie also has a cast of excellent actors and every scene is shot on location. It has a high production value and will stand the test it time.If you fact check the movie, you'll find that everything portrayed in the movie is true. Of course show me seems we're probably amplifying to keep the continuity in the energy of the movie moving along and to keep the audience interested.",10/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"I know that you can only fit so much into a 2 hour film, but this left me wanting to see so much more. My parents both came to Christ through the Jesus People Movement. In the early years of their marriage, they attended a Calvary Chapel off-shoot in Western New York, so I grew up with the names Chuck Smith & Greg Laurie, but didn't know much beyond that.I watched this film with my parents, as well as our Pastor (we attend a Calvary Chapel-connected Church) and about 30 others from our congregation. It felt a bit like a private screening. So many of them were laughing along, crying along, or nudging each other with whispers of ""Remember that?""
I really appreciated that they kept some of the ""dirty"" not-so-appealing things in the film. Nothing & No One is perfect, so it was nice to have the balance between Joy & Discontent.The casting was great and the costumes were spot on. Congratulations to everyone who worked on the film.",8/10
Jesus Revolution (2023),"I have attended Calvary Chapel for years but never really knew the history of it until now. This was a well told history of a movement that shares the Gospel message in real and powerful way. The Jesus movement of the 60s and 70s came out of the hippie culture in an unexpected way. The telling is new but the story is age old. God uses a humble man of seemingly no importance to reach a generation. Love the actors, the careful attention to storytelling and the overall authenticity of it. The characters are developed carefully, backstory thoroughly explained. I absolutely love the inclusion of primary source film that tells what happens after the events of the movie. Definitely worth watching.",9/10
Glass Onion (2022),"I liked the first Knives Out a lot because it felt like a warm homage to all those Agatha Christie novels that I like (books and movies): it got an interesting case and setting, a well playing cast, a fine production. Glass Onion is a little different - the story/crime is for
sure not that interesting or complex and there is a far stronger emphasis on comedy. One could dare to say that Glass Onion is more of a parody than a ""real"" crime case. The first movie got a straight 8, this one, did entertain me too (despite some lengthy parts) - but compared to the first movie, Glass Onion is for sure a big step in the wrong direction (for my taste) - it reminds me a lot of those mediocre attempts of Kenneth Brannagh's to revive Hercule Poirot. Also I do not like the ending at all, too a certain degree it is just a stupid one. Hopefully, the next one focuses again more on a complex crime case and its build up and last but not least, a real interesting and surprising ending like the first one got.",5/10
Glass Onion (2022),"The casting and performances by all were outstanding, especially Bautista and Norton, and I really liked the setting in Greece, but I feel the ending ruined what could've been a better sequel. There certainly was some creative ideas in the narrative, and even though the start was slow and tedious, it did get better when Benoit Blanc started to unravel the mystery. However, the unravelling was too as-a-matter-of-factly and too convenient in its set-up. And normally I'd be fine with that, because the few twists were a nice touch, but then right after the mystery was solved, the ridiculous antics just became too unbelievable and quite frankly, unnecessary. Still, and enjoyable one-time watch, especially if you enjoyed the first one.",7/10
Glass Onion (2022),"As a mystery lover, this one disappointed me. The first movie, KNIVES OUT, was a reasonable reworking of the murder mystery genre but this one merely copies that and forget to be a mystery in its own right. It instead becomes an open satire of the mega rich and a certain Twitter-owning individual in particular, which is fine, but I couldn't help but feel this was missold. The first half is enjoyable, Craig's broad performance in particular a hoot, but then we start breaking all of the rules and overflowing with cliches. There's an excruciating fifty-minute flashback, a cheesy twin twist, and even the old saved-by-a-bullet-hitting-something-in-their-pocket moment, which I openly groaned at. As for the mindlessly destructive climax, is this the best they could come up with?",3/10
Glass Onion (2022),"After the first Knives Out I was expecting better than this. As Benoit pointed out the whole thing is stupid. Ironic really, i mean was that what this was supposed to be ?? A big fat Ironic slap in the face.The acting was slapstick, over dramatic silliness. Not like the first film which was subtle black comedy. This was in your face amateur stage play style stuff.The plot tries to be clever and has a few reveals but none are particularly jarring nor interesting. The overall message seemed to be beware of Shills.Poor plot, poor acting, poor start and poor ending. There is a moment in the middle when you think there is hope for this yarn but it just fizzles out like a burn't napkin. Probably the same napkin the script was written on.When the credits roll your just left with a sinking feeling you were the one conned. No idea how its got a high rating, probably due to all the dreck thats been released this Christmas.5/10.",5/10
Glass Onion (2022),"What happened?!I am so bitterly confused!I was looking forward to this film so much after Knives Out instantly becoming one of my all time favourites.Did I overhype it? Were my expectations too high? Did I watch the same film as the critics?By all means, I'm not saying this is a bad film but compared to the original, it misses rather hard. What an absolute let down.I have no complaints about the cast, the score, the cinematography, the direction etc. It's the writing. Did Rian Johnson just forget what sort of film he was writing or something? It certainly showed a lot of promise in the first act, it definitely had me intruiged. The middle act had it's moments of twists and revelations I suppose. But the last act - what happened? What a mess. There was no pay off. It was such an unsatisfying conclusion. Honestly, it felt like they may as well have just said; ""It was all a dream"". It was so much off the mark which really hurts.I'm glad to see that I guess a lot of people enjoyed it and maybe the next installment will be better. One can only hope.",5/10
Glass Onion (2022),"I feel as though there's something 'wrong' with me. So many people I know, and respect, DID truly enjoy 'Glass Onion'. But for me, this film was so over-the-top that I continually felt as though I were watching a TV sit-com or vaudeville show. That, not a film during which several central characters actually are murdered. And a murderer must be uncovered.By 'over-the-top' I mean this. (1) The acting was as broad as a slap-stick comedy. (2) The dialogue was not the least bit anchored in anything approaching reality. (3) The look of the film, the overdone brightness and color saturation of the production, made it almost an animated feature. And finally (4) there is the issue of Daniel Craig's dialect, which I have to say I found annoying. At best.A group of people are invited to a Greek Island on which a game will be played. But once there they learn that the game has already begun and that murder, or the prevention of it, is the game's objective. As with Agatha Christy mysteries, each invitee has a reason to murder someone, and with the group unable to depart the island, murder will no doubt take place. But - for the reasons outlined above - we (or 'I') did not care. On the positive side I enjoyed Kate Hudson as an aging beauty. As to the rest of the performances, the less said the better, but Edward Norton as the island's host stands out in terms of his being entirely miscast.I don't want to say more, for fear of giving too much away.So, that's it. If you're anything like my friends, you'll enjoy this piece of nonsense.But if you're anything like me, you'll cringe. And perhaps seek out some new friends.",2/10
Glass Onion (2022),"Pffff......Netflix these days has got a lot of financial, power, BUT that (unfortunately) does NOT equal CREATIVE power. What's wrong with this movie? It sure as heck is BORING.

If your are cool with that, okay be my guest and watch it for yourself...Netflix is not all bad for the cinema experience, but unfortunately A LOT of so called Netflix ""movies"" are formula pictures based on database searches what are the most common preferences most people like. The result? A BLAND and PREDICTABLE story.Is it all bad? Nope. The acting performances are okay. Edward Norton is always fun to watch.

Glass Onion (2022),"I really enjoyed Knives Out and was looking forward to the sequel with much anticipation ever since it was announced. I was, however, disappointed.With Glass Onion, director and writer Rian Johnson shows once again that he can carefully craft an intriguing story with brilliant direction. But with a bigger budget comes many challenges and unfortunately the movie fails when it is trying too be too extravagant and a spectacle for the viewers.The core story is very interesting and after a dull start, the middle of the film really hits it's stride with Johnson moving his playing pieces about with ease and wonderment. That was when i most enjoyed the movie.But the ending was ultimately disappointing. Childish humour and some sequences that were clearly for spectacle which i can only describe as 'throwing a tantrum' ruined this movie for me.I had some fun with this but was left feeling robbed as there was definitely a compelling enough story here for this to be another great movie. I do feel the more intimate character/story driven moments in this film are where it shines and not in the big budget set pieces.Watch this if you enjoy the genre, but please lower your expectations before doing so!",6/10
Glass Onion (2022),"The genre/plot is almost like the old one with a little bit of gameplay sprinkled on top of it.There were some aha moments & some thrilling ones as well but we just feel like keep comparing it to its previous one and maybe that's why it wasn't enjoyable to me personally to the level where the first one was.It is still notable that with the same kinda investigative plot, the movie still keeps you hooked till the very end, of course only if you like watching movies of this genre.And the best part of this installment is that you get to see a lot of different places, just more pleasing to the eyes when compared to its previous one, although the whole movie happens on just one single island.Overall, it's a good one-time if you haven't watched the first part.",6/10
Glass Onion (2022),"Put an A-List cast in a film with bad writing, give them a poor director who elicits wooden acting, make the whole thing boring and predictable, then nominate this mess for a bunch of awards-and you have another clumsy, dull, ghastly product from the dying west. Beginning in the opening scene, this is one of the worst movies ever made, and the fact it still gets rave reviews here and nominations out there makes this decline complete. There are far better films and series coming from international filmmaking today. I miss great moviemaking from Hollywood-the classics going back over a hundred years. But we have forgotten how to make great movies, and audiences have forgotten what they even are. Good grief this is awful.",2/10
Glass Onion (2022),"I really wanted to like this, but the direction was lacklustre. When you have a very complicated plot, then editing, pacing and direction are critical. This is not nearly as much fun as the first Knives Out, and the dialogue is strained. The players try very hard, but it's all a jumble of dialogue and information with no time to enjoy the puzzle. It might be better second time around, so I will watch on tv in a couple of months.In particular, Daniel Craig's southern gentleman detective is far too noisy, bumbling, and silly. Most of the other characters are almost clichés. The whole movie looks rushed into production, a desperate attempt to make up for losses during COVID.Too bad. Perhaps a ""directors cut"" might be better.",6/10
Glass Onion (2022),"In my criticism of the first knives out movie I questioned the silly accent of Daniel Craig and the mediocre acting. It's a masterpiece compared to this crock. Ed Norton is completely OTT, Kate Hudson proves yet again that she is a poor actor, at best, and Daniel Craig should be ashamed at taking the money. The rest of the cast try hard but either don't have the skills or were handed awful scripts and parts.I really don't get what the fuss is about. The storyline is derivative, tired and obvious. Some of the sfx are extremely entertaining but it doesn't make up for an utter piece of rubbish. Like the first film, it can't make up its mind whether it is serious, comedy or pastiche. It completely fails as a film but maybe it boosts Netflix profits particularly in the cynical way it was released. Critics who love the lovers rate it but there really are better ways to spend you time.",4/10
Glass Onion (2022),"Watching on the big screen, at its best this would be a solid 8+/10 movie, but there are a few areas that let it down.First is the excessive lockdown/mask/Zoom scenes at the start of the film. This was never good comedic or dramatic material in the first place, and has already aged badly.Second is a somewhat over-the-top finale which aims for spectacular but ends up a bit silly - and that isn't where a murder-mystery should be. Less is more.But the greatest problem is the decision to re-tell the whole story from a different perspective half-way through. After carefully building the tension so that darkness falls with a murderer on the loose... the audience is taken back to the start again. It completely ruins the momentum of the film. Granted, this does allow the reveal to be even more complicated, but it also greatly reduces the wow-factor of Benoit Blanc's deduction. The genius detective solving the case is the fulcrum of this kind of movie and shouldn't be diminished.Production values are high, and the supporting cast are good, although some have fairly slender roles. Kate Hudson is superb as Birdie.In conclusion, I'm pleased to see Blanc back. Daniel Craig brought more eccentricity to the character this time around, but I liked it. A modern-day Poirot. I'd happily see a series of his adventures on the big screen. Just return to a more traditional murder-mystery structure (please).",7/10
Glass Onion (2022),"The movie ""Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery"" has a good premise but lacks originality and personality. The film is simply similar to any mystery movie based on the works of Agatha Christie. Even Daniel Craig's character Benoit Blanc is a low copy of Hercule Poirot. It's a good premise because it updates the characters to current times, parodying some current celebrities. The film is about a group of old friends who are invited to a private island for the weekend to participate in a fictional game of murder. The problem is that all the guests have enough motives to murder the millionaire friend who owns the island. The surprise is that the most famous detective in the world is also unexpectedly invited. As you can see, nothing original.",4/10
Glass Onion (2022),This movie is trying desperately to be like the movie Clue and completely misses the mark. At least Clue is funny. This is stupid. It is visually nice but intellectually inferior. Its plot is more convoluted and hard to follow than Clue could ever be. There are some scarce moments of something interesting but that's nowhere near enough to save this trainwreck. Daniel Craig as Benoit Blanc is such a caricature of Sherlock Holmes that he's hard to take seriously. Dave Bautista can't act if his life depended on it. Kate Hudson acted like an absolute idiot. This movie is supposed to be taken seriously but it's impossible to with the goofy acting and ridiculous plot. The first Knives Out was great. This is as dead as a murdered corpse.,3/10
Glass Onion (2022),"So let me start by saying that I really enjoyed watching this movie until that ending happened. The movie is 2 hours and 20 minutes and not one minute of it is boring, so it's enjoyable - nearly - through and through.The acting is decent but there's not really much given to the actors to work with, unlike the first movie. The music is good too and it's a good-looking movie visually, though the cinematography, editing, and direction lack in my opinion, and don't really shine and aren't that memorable.The direction is ok, but the writing and the lack of editing the way the first movie had, make this movie, at least to me, feel like it was one of those sequels to a lucky successful original movie made by a good and experienced director that the studio orders and gives it to a lesser and worse director.And this might seem like a dumb complaint, but it affects the experience of watching the movie anyway; I did not like the bigger aspect ratio and the color grading at all. It makes me feel like I'm watching an episode of a tv show or a tv movie or a reality show, especially the fact that they're on a private island. The black bars at the top and bottom of movies with the aspect ratio of 1920x800 make every ""video"" feel more cinematic and make you feel like you're watching a movie. It's standard in every video game that you see the aspect ratio change when they cut or transition to a cutscene and the black bars appear.Now I don't have a problem with IMAX movies and of course, they're cool-looking and have better quality, though I'm not sure if this was filmed on IMAX which I highly doubt. But IMAX is only used in some parts of movies like Mission Impossible and Top Gun Maverick's huge action scenes. But I don't really care for a whole movie like that. Though it obviously works in tv shows and some other movies, it didn't really work for this movie for me at least, and I would've preferred the standard aspect ratio.The other thing is the color grading which if I recall correctly, the first movie had a warmer and more saturated color grading that was perfect for that movie and also made it more cinematic. But this movie has a cooler (colder) color grading and also makes it look less like high production cinematic movie and more like an episode of a tv show.There just wasn't anything significant or remarkable about the editing, cinematography, and direction that would make me think it was made by an experienced and skilled director, let alone the same guy who wrote and made Knives Out.Now I know that all of this was intentional and Rian Johnson said in the YouTube interview that he wanted these sequels to be completely different from the first one and each other in all aspects, different story, completely different actors and characters (save for 007 of course), and a different tone and feel. But after watching this movie I don't think that was a good thing if it meant that it's gonna be inferior in every aspect compared to the first movie. It's a good thing that he wants to do different movies with a different tone and feel and look for the sequels and not do the same thing over and over, but unfortunately, I would've preferred if this movie was more like the first one or at least on the same level.So technical and visual stuff aside, the script was obviously, as most reviews have already said, nowhere near as good as Knives Out's. I think Rian had all this time and money on his hand and he should've at least consulted other writers and worked more on the script, especially on the ending.The ending just seems weird, childish, and not a satisfying conclusion at all, if you can even call it a conclusion. I kept waiting for something clever to happen with the Mona Lisa, but the exact opposite of clever happens with it just to have the protagonist recite a line that was said earlier so everything can come together and have a payoff and a gotcha moment with the villain. Literally a ""bro think he Walter White💀"" meme happens as the climax of the movie and you know what I'm talking about if you've watched the movie. There's just really no payoff to the whole ""whodunnit"" aspect of the story and the ending immediately made the movie so forgettable that if someone mentions Knives Out, my mind won't even go to this sequel and I'm gonna forget it in a couple of days.The movie obviously has a lot of setups and payoffs and the second act's flashbacks connect all the loose ends, but honestly, they're not really that interesting (they are at the time you're watching them) because the story and the characters and the writing are not that interesting and certainly not as interesting or good as Knives Out's.There are some cringey lines and jokes here and there too and many pop culture references, cringey ones, that make you go, ""yup, this is a modern movie alright"".The script also feels like it was written by someone who feels they're really clever, but ultimately, they're really not and the script isn't that interesting. So I understand why people would give this movie a 5 or even a 4 especially when you expected something at least on the same level as Knives Out, but I'll give it a 6 since I enjoyed most of it and it's honestly not really as bad the negative reviews might make it out to be, but it's definitely not as good as all the 10s, 9s, and the 8s reviews say it is.So in short, this is unfortunately another Netflix movie that you already know it's not gonna be good when you see the red logo on the poster. Lackluster writing, unremarkable editing, and direction, uninteresting story and characters, could've had a better color grading and aspect ratio, Benoit doesn't do much especially in the end, the story and the twists and turns, like Benoit said it himself in the movie, aren't as complex and satisfying as Knives Out's, the ending not satisfying and is baffling, weird, and subpar instead.I just hope Rian Johnson works more on the script of the next sequel and also gets another good writer to help him with it, because these movies are whodunnits and are more about the writing and the dialogue, and this just wasn't it.I am also noticing a pattern with the twists of these movies about who actually did it and I hope it's not the same with the third movie because I already can guess who the actual murderer of the third one is before they even announce the cast.",6/10

Glass Onion (2022),"While ""Glass Onion"" is visually dynamic with good pacing and a compelling plot line, it simply doesn't match the total package provided in its original, ""Knives Out."" In fact, being associated with the well-written and directed first version is a big part of the problem. If ""Glass Onion"" were released as its own film with no association to KO, it might be better accepted. ""Knives Out"" was a reasonably realistic story with well-defined characters we identified with very quickly, which helped draw the audience into the film. It used dry humor and wit to drive home its points. ""Glass Onion,"" in contrast, is based upon an absurd, convoluted and childish plot that would be more appropriate in a superhero movie than an adult mystery. It is entirely unbelievable by any stretch of the imagination. The characters in this film don't use snappy dialogue and sharp retorts, they scream obnoxious and idiotic nonsense as if noise is supposed to make up for lack of a meaningful script. The cast of ""Knives Out"" was well-chosen, displaying chemistry with each other and the audience throughout its run time. In GO, chemistry between the players is absent; even Daniel Craig's inspector portrayal is reduced to a caricature in this sequel. ""Glass Onion"" is not an absolute disaster. It works as pass-the-time entertainment, offering enough visual stimulation to hold our attention.

Glass Onion (2022),"It seems like many people want to debate whether this movie was better than it's predecessor. It is an interesting discussion, I suppose.

I don't need brilliant directors forced to paint by numbers. I don't need every movie to look the same. But if Netflix wants to let Rian Johnson keep making Knives Out movies? Sign me up, baby.

At one point I almost wanted to scream at the screen. As for the white family, or side of the family, they're ignorance, to me, was them just trying to make the girl feel welcomed, in their own misguided way. There were times when this movie actually became a tad bit painful to watch. I know they're supposed to be a moral to this, but this movie almost promoted racism. They, in my opinion, wanted to turn the white mom interest a ""Karen"" unfairly. I actually felt bad for her because she didn't realize what she was doing and it was brought to her attention in a horrible way. Also, I think Jonah Hill's character was much stronger than Lauren London's character, Amira.Also, side note! It annoyed me that Eddie Murphy said the ""N"" word in every other sentence in this movie but took issue with white people.

And those that failed to direct the all-star cast properly, so they all ended up being unconvincing in everything they did and said.I've seen failed SNL sketches with better execution, more urgency in the acting, with coherent and cohesive dialogue. But instead, those people gave us a long, dragged out, boring and shallow blah-blah commentary, with zero laughs, that will have you struggle to stay awake in this predictable sloth-paced nonsense.Such a waste of a talented cast. This is one of those films that is more annoying than entertaining, and aside from the predictable romance as the core of the film, everything else is just forced, feels phony, and flops from every angle. I can't even suggest it's a decent one-time watch, because I feel like I've wasted 2 hours I'll never get back.",4/10
You People (2023),"When mum turned to watch this godforsaken movie on Netflix, it was honestly so unbearable to watch but yet I sat through it all and felt that I need @5 118 minutes back. The amount of black this, white that, every skin colour being aggressively mentioned on the show made it just so tiring and extremely annoying. I don't care if you're every colour of the rainbow like cmon man this is 21st century, enough with the labels and make a decent movie goddamnitt!The cast were good but the writing and the aggressive label slapping made it such a bad movie.

You People (2023),"In recent years, Hill has tried to branch out on his own with his Directors debut and other various works but with this last project its apparent hes incapable of being great while taking the lead. Films like Moneyball and Wolf of Wall Street were great because of good direction, spectacular writing and good lead actors.You People...Screenwriters/Director Kenya Barris and Jonah Hill do a masterful job depicting racism and twisting it into their own definition of comedy. The result? Cringe with a splash of garbage is exactly what this film was.Love Jonah Hill but not when hes taking charge.Glad this was free. I just cant get back those precious minutes i could have used to watch paint dry.",1/10
You People (2023),"How did this ever get made? Old Man Jonah Hill is miscast as a 35 year old who wants to marry a black woman. Only problem is their families, one Jewish and one Muslim, don't get along. In fact, they have a lot of very insensitive conversations about race and religion. I supposed someone thought this was funny, but it is not. The attempts at humor fall very flat. The jokes are not funny. The cast looks bored. Film looks like it was made in one or two takes and a lot of the dialogue feels like they just made it up as they went along. It's almost shocking this many talented people got in a room and said and did so much stupid unfunny stuff. A miserable comedy.",1/10
You People (2023),"This movie, if you can call it that, is pretty bad. The humour is forced and not funny. The way people think in it is the way the most stupid elements of society think, a tiny minority, thank God. The cliches and stereotypes are horrible because they're so unrealistic here. Like a black Moslem would never use n-gga to address a black person or anyone else actually. This is exactly the kind of behavior they're against. I could take satire but this is out of this world. Eddie Murphy looks so out of it in this movie, like he couldn't wait for the whole thing to be over. I guess he's in it because he thinks he has to stay relevant. Also the production of the movie itself is lame. There's no artistry to it whatsoever. It could have been shot with one of today's quality phones and edited on a home computer.Believe the rating here. This movie is going nowhere.",1/10
You People (2023),"First, let me tell you what I like about this movie: I guess I would say that Julia's new face is pretty cool. Clearly she recently had a facelift.Now what I don't like about this film: as other reviewers have said, this movie was trying to be both a comedy and a social commentary. But neither one of them worked. And then we have the usual stereotypes: all Black people are angry about their oppression and aren't afraid to tell the world about it. The Black people are streetsmart and intelligent. But then we have the white people. They are all clueless, racist, and guilt ridden. Every word out of their mouths is racist and of course they don't even know that it is. This is really getting old. Why can't we just have a movie with white people and Black people being normal human beings. But I guess Hollywood needs to preach it's politics to us, so it's probably not going to end soon.",2/10
You People (2023),"It's been some time that I've been so bewildered and frustrated watching a film.This very talented cast is absolutely wasted on a terrible script filled with inane and outdated jokes. It's 2023, I think we've moved beyond the ridiculous viewpoints and stereotypes displayed in this film. The characters behave in such ridiculous ways. Eddie Murphy suddenly just decides to stop being a racist piece of crap and Julia Louis-Dreyfus has an awakening about how to speak to black people normally. It's all just so freaking annoying to watch.Hill and London also have net zero chemistry between them, which funny enough, really tends to tank a romantic comedy.",4/10
You People (2023),"You People is so poorly written and 'unintentionally' racist that you'd think it was written by Michael Scott. The entire movie is basically an amalgamation of the worst stereotypes around black, 'muslim' (I use air quotes because the characters are actually NOI members the movie misleadingly portrays as muslim), and jewish people despite its message purportedly being the opposite. Actually, I'm not entirely sure what their message was supposed to be but to me it basically came off as promoting segregation.This movie is pretty much a symbol of everything wrong with post-2015 Hollywood social commentaries... it's almost like twitter addiction has melted the mind of every writer in LA. It got so bad at points that I started to wonder if it was a conservative strawman/parody of urban progressives.Beyond that the jokes/culture references are mostly 10 years out of date and unfunny, the soundtrack rarely aligns with the scenes it plays over, the transitions between scenes look straight out of a mid 2000's disney channel show, and I'm not sure what possessed the creators to cast Jonah Hill of all people as a 'likable' lead in a romantic comedy -- it just doesn't work.",2/10
You People (2023),"You People is definitely a 5 but at least a somewhat watchable and likable 5. It definitely had a few funny moments overall. But it absolutely tried WAY TOO hard to be a good movie and to be funny and to call attention to race relations. It was just way too much of an over exaggeration by both sides. While sometimes it was funny, it was mainly just in your face and way over done. The story itself was fairly straightforward and very obvious. It's worth watching just because it's free and on Netflix but don't expect anything legitimately good. IMDb needs to chill with these character limits!!!!!",5/10
You People (2023),"Even Julia Louis-Dreyfuss can't save this one. Did it have a good premise? It sure did, for about forty years ago.So, they took a tired old storyline, added in some pretty good talent which might have saved it, then stupidly added in the requisite Hollywood dreck that completely ruined it - they had to make it non-stop about black vs. White and they did it about as poorly and tediously as they possibly could. The endless comments and ""jokes"" are incredibly tiresome and do nothing to bring anyone together, especially not the audience, they only serve to further alienate us from each other.Honestly, just a huge waste of some good actors and the viewers time.",2/10

Every character talks in that quick witted way that only happens in the movies, after a while it becomes slightly wearing as its so unrealistic but not as unrealist and really annoying all the white characters do that desparate trying not to sound racist but ending up sounding racist dialogue that has been done to death in so many comedies.

So much to pick at.In an era of increasing antisemitic violence, a movie like this just fuels the flames.If it were on screen, there would be protests at the theatres.",1/10
You People (2023),"Ezra Cohen (Jonah Hill) is a stockbroker who also runs a podcast with his best friend, Mo (Sam Jay), where the two discuss various facets of black culture (or ""the culture"" as Ezra calls it). Ezra is under pressure from his Jewish family particularly his mother Shelley (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) to find a woman but Ezra has a streak of bad luck with his family's setups. Meanwhile costume designer Amira Mohammed (Lauren London) is also dealing with pressure from her opinionated father Akbar (Eddie Murphy) a devout Black Muslim. When Ezra and Amira have a chance encounter they eventually start a relationship until after some time Ezra intends to propose to Amira, but the two's families prove to be a massive obstacle.You People is a new romantic comedy directed and co-written by Black-ish creator Kenya Barris and co-written and starring Jonah Hill. The movie features an impressive cast with the likes of Jonah Hill, Eddie Murphy, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Nia Long, and Deavid Duchovny among several others, and from the marketing you'd probably expect a modern update the framework established by Guess Who's Coming to Dinner with its potentially rich premise of a Jewish family and Black Muslim family creating friction with one another over an incoming wedding, unfortunately while You People has a potentially rich and provocative setup, its payoff feels like a tired rehash of the Fockers films or 2005's Guess Who? With little more brought to the table than an R-rating.On a positive note, I will say that Hill and London have decent chemistry in their scenes together and on occasion there is an awkward laugh to be taken from individual exchanges in the film, but for the most part the movie doesn't feel like it has a developed cast of characters with most of the talented expanded cast playing very broad one note at best or are given the short shrift at worst. Poor David Duchovny is saddle with a terrible running gag about him going on shpiel's about Xzibit and Elliott Gould is given one line and spends most his presence in the background doing nothing most of the time. Eddie Murphy is also saddled with a role that doesn't play to his strengths as Akbar is a very serious and stoic man who isn't funny or interesting because he's been force to subdue his charisma and he really only comes to life in the role in the last 10 minutes. A large chunk of the movie is an endless parade of scenes where either Ezra or his parents make fools of themselves giving rambling unsolicited commentary on race relations and there's very few scenes where people talk like human beings and these segments are just variations on the same point repeatedly. The movie is also way too long at just under two hours and it feels its length.You People had a lot of promise as a comedy, but it just does not work at all and most of the best scenes are in the trailer with the rest of the movie an overlong slog that struggles to keep itself going. Sometimes the cast do get a mild snicker from certain exchanges, but not really enough to justify a viewing. Maybe if someone like Jerrod Carmichael had tapped into this kind of material (see On the Count of Three or The Carmichael Show for proof) then maybe something of substance could've been done with it, but as is, it's a mediocre comedy that feels like 2005's Guess Who? With an R-rating.",5/10
You People (2023),"It's very difficult to try to receive a film that collides not only two cultures, but four if we consider the religions of the characters. It's even more difficult when the viewer doesn't belong to any of the 4 cultures on display. And as if that were not enough, it's even more difficult when the tone of the film is a comedy that tries to speak supposed truths through the comic voice of Jonah Hill and Eddie Murphy.Everyone's speech feels forced, exaggerated and awkward and I think only the latter was intended. I find it one of the most uncomfortable movies to watch, but not only because of the cultural collision, but also because the characters were real idiots, including the leading couple. Everything would have been easier if they were in charge of the wedding themselves to avoid all the chaos generated by decisions that were made by people who were never supposed to have made them. Although without this, we would not have a movie either.Now, it's not all bad. I like the aesthetics of the film, I like the cultural niche in which it's inserted, I like the directorial work behind the shots. I really hope to see reviews from moviegoers who do have a real sense of belonging in the social circles that are exposed in the film, because this would definitely be a much more valid opinion.",5/10

A lot of moronic and unnecessary cursing.It has a great cast but even with that, the writing is just awful. I never laughed. Not even once!!!Watching paint dry is way more exciting than watching this snoozefest.It is unfortunate that there are no good comedies anymore. Nowaday´s movies are about sci-fi (mostly super heroes), horror and drama. No wonder why many people are so depressed. Good movies and good music are sadly a thing from the past now.I rather watch reruns of Eddie Murphy´s 80s films and his 80s stand ups Delirious and Raw and reruns of Seinfeld (with Julia Louis-Dreyfuss as Elaine) and The X-Files (With David Duchovny as FBI Agent Mulder).",1/10
You People (2023),"Not a surprise, I guess.What did I know about this movie? Eddie Murphy is in it. For me he still has the stigma that I'm gonna get some good laughs if he does this movie. Jonah Hill is in this movie. I think Jonah Hill is funny. He has the perfect wit for Eddie to bounce jokes off of. I also saw in the trailer Nia Long is in it and I felt she was a fine enough actress for Eddie to bounce jokes off of.None of that happened. Julia Louis Dreyfuss and David Duchovny are also in the movie and they were ready to make us laugh and they did but it was so minimal. Can't say I did not laugh but I was hoping this cast would give me far more than they did.There was a point in which comedian Mike Epps, who gave me bigger laughs than Murphy, were doing a scene together and I got nothing.Comedian Andrew Schulz was in the movie, involved in a scene that had me giggling when I should have been busting a gut.All I can say is Kenya Burris hit the motherload with Blackish and the universeish (I don't know if that's what it's called), but he can't replicate it. BlackAF was a very bad replication of Blackish and You People also seems to take elements Burris touched on before, (which is not a bad thing, do what you know) but somehow it just never matches the Gold he did with Blackish.His comedy on mixed relations is getting tired, You People felt tired, and it seemed that all Eddie was doing was playing Kenya Burris and that's not what this movie needed.Not as bad as I am making it out to be but all I see is something that could have been so much better.",5/10

Julia Louis-Dreyfus was so stupid and annoying - and those qualities do not equate to funny. David Duchovny had really nothing to do but act like a spaced-out jackass - so well done for him.

Something fresh, something new under the sun. I'm not sure if it's the studios, writers or talent, but a major part of that team is resting on their laurels.I loved the casting of old school comedic actors that are likely singing their swan song. The plot is tried and true, and it normally works.

All the movie's factors are fully qualified. What more can I say? It is the masterpiece.",10/10
Titanic (1997),"The stage curtains open ...Not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""Braveheart"", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with ""Titanic"". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen. The direction is tight, the special effects phenomenal, and the acting completely believable. DiCaprio and Winslet had perfect chemistry. I was affected and moved by ""Titanic"". And even knowing the outcome, I will happily get on board again and again.",10/10

Titanic (1997),"Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story. Apart from that, the film was thrilling, exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word!",10/10
Titanic (1997),"Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old Rose boards the ship with her controlling fiancé, Cal Hockley and her desperate for money mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a first-class formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing, music and beer in third-class. After revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks, they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape together.So does Titanic live up to it's hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and Leo Mania was born at the time. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but please don't let the haters bother you from watching this great movie. It has great acting, amazing effects, beautiful costumes, outstanding sets, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. Otherwise I don't think we'd still be talking about it so many years later. Kate and Leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time. Despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot, I think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together. James Cameron, the extreme perfectionist that he is, went over time and money budgets for Titanic, but this was his baby and it paid off very well. James had captured everything about Titanic and the sinking so well. He respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn't just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage. He had every right in my opinion to scream ""I'm king of the world!"" at the Oscars, because this movie blew everyone out of the water(no pun intended), you know what? I'm going to admit it, I love Titanic, even past my teen years I absolutely adore this movie, it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too since I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. Remember one thing, be true to yourself, don't follow the crowd, lovers or haters, if you go with the hype you're always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it, then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever. I do recommend Titanic, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.10/10",10/10
Titanic (1997),"Good Lord. This movie right here, it's a masterpiece. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Tonight was the first time I watched this. I watched some parts of it earlier, but I thought it would probably be boring, and that I had better things to do. Tonight I watched the whole thing with my grandmother. I was completely wrong on that. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played ""Nearer, My God, to Thee"" and the end when all those perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack. This movie was absolutely amazing and I would watch it over and over again.",10/10
Titanic (1997),"""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.",10/10
Titanic (1997),"To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it?  IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss.  The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think.  I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book.  It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted.  I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that?  It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet.  I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.",10/10
Titanic (1997),"""Titanic"" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.I give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. And, now that I think about this, this is exactly how I viewed director Cameron's other huge success, ""Avatar"". Well worth seeing once.",9/10
Titanic (1997),"I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see."" I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost ""you are there"" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect ""t"" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of ""My Heart Goes On.""Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats.A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.9/10.",9/10

Titanic (1997),"If you're a Millennial like me, you probably experienced the phenomena known as 'Titanic-mania' during your childhood, where everyone was obsessed with this movie. It was in theatres for almost a year, and every girl between 8-20 was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio. Titanic was everywhere in the late 1990s, and because of its popularity and reputation as a gushy romance movie popular with teenage girls, it attracted a lot of hate. Despite winning numerous Oscars, Titanic, for the longest time, had a negative reputation, especially among men.In hindsight, if you had your image of Titanic shaped by the negative media landscape surrounding it in the late 90s to the 2000s, I highly suggest you give it another go. It really is a wonderful film, and it's enjoyable and fun even if you're a guy. The special effects are second to none, the acting is great and James Horner's soundtrack is absolutely majestic. Even the love story itself, while a bit gushy in parts, is actually quite sweet and endearing. Both Rose and Jack are full realized, strong characters who you care about.My advice, especially to 20-30 something year old men who were told all their life that 'Titanic sucks', is to give it a chance. You're sleeping on not only a great drama, but a great action movie as well.",9/10
Titanic (1997),"You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding! Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful & tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!",10/10
Titanic (1997),"Flawless, enchanting, riveting, wondrous, totally out of this world. Astounding as this may sound, I've just now got around to watching ""Titanic,"" 23 years on, and I'm staggered at all that I've missed my whole life.Young love is the most wonderful theme to explore in a movie, but it's also the most difficult to depict beautifully and without too much cloying treacle. Couple that with the story of a young teenage girl in the bygone era of aristocrat families and arranged marriage, side saddles and corsets, outrageous class inequality and rich powerful men in control of everything and keeping women under their thumbs - and you get ""Titanic."" And James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet cracked it with a bang! They impressed. They dazzled. They shined.They took our breath away.",10/10
Titanic (1997),"Titanic is a true masterpiece and is easily one of the greatest films in history. James Cameron has outdone himself with this epic film that is clearly one for the ages. It is perfect in almost every way and can be watched over and over again. From the directing, beautiful photography and an immortal song by Celine Dion. Not only is a masterful depiction of the sinking of the Titanic but a great love story. Romance is my lowest rated genre so it takes a really well made love story for me to like it and Titanic showcased this. Worthy of all its Oscars and revenue this film has etched itself as one of the great triumphs of cinema. It is loved universally and it is truly timeless.",10/10
Titanic (1997),"Titanic is one of my all time favourite films. I'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. We all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being ""unsinkable"" - tease the audience, almost to the point where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'I thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: I cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. Taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like Fabrizio and Murdoch the First Officer and countless more. It was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. You remember Jack telling Rose all the places he's going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. The Irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. The violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. And the music! Wow. I cried for all of this. And especially right at the end when you see the photos of Rose's life, knowing she's fulfilled her promise and survived, living a full life, probably never having met anyone she loved as much as Jack all those years ago.Visually pleasing in every way, dramatic, musically astounding, great acting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic, enduring film. A romantic-drama unlike any other. It deserves higher than 7.7.",10/10

Titanic (1997),"I am still crying as I am writing this review as of right now. I don't even know where to begin. I can now see why this film was one of the highest grossing movies of all time. The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred. James Cameron you are and will always be one of the best filmmakers to ever live and this is your ultimate masterpiece.",10/10

Titanic (1997),"I wake up in the middle of the night with total anxiety.While the fictional story line is fairly cliche and some of the characters are a little cringe (Bill Paxton's hair and earring, for example), the truth is this: 1,517 people died horrible deaths in the icy Atlantic in the dead of night. That eats at me constantly. I think of some of them being all cozy in their beds, happily dreaming of going to America, and suddenly they are waken by the rumbling of the iceberg hit, by the alarms, by the sounds of rising panic and the unbelievably coldness of the weather and water. It saddens me to this day.I caught the movie yet again while channel surfing and sure enough, I stopped and ended up watching the last 90 minutes. The recreation of the sinking is amazing and horrifying. The details presented put you right there. I always put myself in that situation mentally and I wonder what would have become of me. No one can truly know until it actually happens. I think about the cold more than anything. I have been in very cold places before, but never getting soaking wet in that cold. The people who ended up alive in the water went through a horrible hell for a few minutes then hypothermia drifted them off to their deaths. It's haunting to think about. I woke up around 3am after having a dream I was in icy water, trying to catch my breath, trying to stay afloat, and not doing very well at either. The anxiety level increased as I began to wake up and I got mad at myself for watching the movie right before going to bed!My thoughts go out to those souls who perished on the Titanic and I hope beyond hope that there is a better place they went to.",10/10
Titanic (1997),"Titanic is the film ive viewed 2nd most of all, i am the kinda guy that can watche a good movie once every 2 to 3 months, and ive seen titanic some 25-30 times and i should know the storyline pretty well.when seeing this in the theater first time alone and the next night with my wife i was lost for words each time. my wife cried the whole night and well into the next night of this lovestory, and whenever i put this in the video, i know ill have the tv space for myself, cause she made a promise to never ever let herself into a mental state again as when watching it the first time.its not so much the act that does this film, its far too cliched' to become a marvel of acting, but its the heart and the cruelty of life and death that crushes my heart each time i see it. the last 15 minutes are the worst, and i usually stop when the flag goes below the surface of the ocean..the grumpy old man might be a cry-baby, but its worth it, the second highest on my ever best movie list",10/10
Titanic (1997),Titanic is world famous. The film that broke every box office record on release and wore the box office champion crown for many years(until it was overtaken by Jim Cameron's Avatar) is special because not only does it showcase the Titanic disaster in all its glory the film is a technical achievement of the highest order. The sinking sequence is astonishing and it feels like you are watching the actual ship sink. The characters and actors are amazing and even with a large running length you never dare look at the watch. James Cameron is a master director and Titanic is his stamp of authority.,10/10
Titanic (1997),"James Cameron's 'Titanic' shares a similar motto to Marmite, ""you either love it or hate it"", I for one love this film, yes I know it's got a drawn out romance story, but there's just something about the 3-hour fill of the film that makes its such a spectacularly emotional and beautiful movie. I saw this a lot when I was growing up, this was one of the films of my childhood, it is truly a powerfully resonant and visually stunning movie of epic proportions. Personally I favour the British original 'A Night to Remember', but this is a pretty close contender. Winner of 11 Oscars, James Cameron's romantic-disaster epic is a triumph of cinema that boasts perfect chemistry between Kate and Leo as the lovers bound for tragedy. Many people disregard this film nowadays solely because it's become the most popular film ever made alongside Cameron's other epic 'Avatar', and whilst 'Titanic' is definitely not one of my favourite films, it's just so powerfully amazing and no doubt at all it has once brought a tear to everyone's eyes. The main aspect I love in this film is James Horner's haunting score that was a key ingredient in the film's success, it is simply perfect, too bad Celine Dion had to close this on her awful pop version. Nonetheless, 'Titanic' is a modern classic and a beautifully spectacular film that will live on.",10/10
Titanic (1997),"From ""Cavalcade"" in 1933 to ""Titanic"" in 1953, ""A Night to Remember"" in 1957 and ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" in 1964, the doom ship Titanic became a voyage of legendary, if tragic, proportions, and in the time leading up to its 85th year spawned a TV movie, a Broadway musical and this masterpiece which had audiences preparing to get tickets for it even before it was finished shooting. The reason is clear: James Cameron, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, the promise of effects like you'd never seen in any movie, and a Celine Dion song sung over the teaser trailer that would shoot her to super-stardom.This is told in flashback through the experiences of the 102 year old survivor Rose Calvert (veteran 1930's movie actress Gloria Stuart, nearly forgotten until cast in this), shocked to see a drawing of herself in pristine condition. The nude drawing of her as a young woman wearing a valuable diamond is found in a safe pulled from the ancient wreckage and she immediately notifies the explorers who are searching for more Titanic artifacts and stories. Arriving with pretty much every single belonging of hers as well as her doting granddaughter, Stuart winces in tears with a sudden memory, but insists on going on with her story.From there, we are swept back decades to the luxurious ship on its maiden and only voyage, and the huge vessel is grandly detailed and scaled as only an epic of this nature can scale it to be. Winslet is engaged to the vain Billy Zane, forced by her desperate mother (Frances Fisher) to tolerate him because they are broke and only have their ""name"" to benefit them. Fisher, obviously having married ""up"" , is ultra snobby to the neuvo riche Kathy Bates, and when she meets Jack Dawson (DiCaprio), she knows trouble lies ahead, and her demeanor is enough iceberg for any young lady. Dawson has saved young Roe from committing suicide in the icy waters below, and their first encounter turns into a love that you know can only end tragically.With real life Titanic passengers Brown, John Jacob Astor and his wife Madeline (which would be a great subject for a separate movie), Benjamin Guggenheim and Isadore and Ida Strauss (another subject that would be a touching film), this mixes in these real life characters with the fictional ones. Zane and his humorless right hand man (David Warner) are great villains, with Zane absolutely vile as he psychotically tries to maintain his stolen dignity when he loses his trophy wife to be to a commoner. Watching Zane go psychotic as he stoops to the depths of evil makes you wish he wouldn't make it off, but the writers have an even better plan for him.The film takes well over 90 minutes before the disaster sequences start, and from then on, it is a dizzying, sometimes headache inducing bit of tense moments as DiCaprio, locked to a metal pole to drowned for daring to love Winslet, struggles to be set free. It goes on a bit too long, but for first time viewers is truly frightening. There were buckets of tears being flowed at the Paramount Studios theater I saw this in prior to the release, and even after half a dozen or so viewings, it can still bring them on.Certainly this is filled with cliches, but they are the type of cliches that have worked since the days of the silent movies. This was probably the first film since ""Gone With the Wind"" to be considered a guaranteed Oscar winner, sweeping a good majority of them when it came out. In many ways,, this has very old fashioned ideals and is thus an old fashioned style movie, one of the last of its kind that still worked (""The Artist"" from 20 years later was a rare exception.) I can watch this once a year and still be emotionally turned to mush by it. That is what makes an instant classic.",10/10

Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"It's been almost eight years since the release of the Magic Mike XXL, which, in my opinion, gave the story the closure it needed. I enjoyed the first two films, minus the cheesy stripper dancing, because they gave you a feel for the lives these men lead as opposed to solely focusing on the stripping aspect. It was surprisingly engrossing. With Magic Mike's Last Dance, it does almost the opposite by focusing solely on Channing Tatum and Salma Hayek's phony romantic plot device as an excuse for Magic Mike to put on one final show, setting the film into a complete fantasy.Now, don't get me wrong. I usually love Salma Hayek, but her acting in this film was terrible. I did not believe her character for one second and some of the lines she delivers are just awkward to watch. I was not buying her and Channing Tatum's romance at all. It was almost painful at times. Everybody else does a serviceable job, but when you have leads that have zero chemistry with each other, it can be a deal breaker.Unfortunately, because of the chosen focal point for the story, the dancing also suffers. We get a decent enough show at the end, but there is only one other dancing scene in the film. The other bits of dancing are just that. Bits because they show them training to put together the show. Not one full dance number from that first dance at the beginning, all the way to the end.Speaking of dancing, none of the dancers have any sort of personality or even play any role in the film other than to just be there as dancers. Thus bringing us back to the issue of the central plot focusing on the wrong thing. They didn't even bring back any of the original dancers to dance or even play any part in the movie besides a cameo group video chat for 2 minutes. The film even builds it up with Mike constantly dodging their phone calls but they do nothing with it and that was probably my biggest disappointment.The only positive thing I can say about it is the direction is well executed. The camera angles, the effects and the editing work in the films favor, but that is not enough to save it from being a bad film.Overall, I couldn't recommend it. The first two are diamonds in the rough, and this one is a rock that sinks straight down to the bottom of the ocean. If it wasn't for Steven Soderbergh's tight direction, I would rate it lower.1.5 pumps out of 5.",3/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"My wife and I saw this on opening night at the movie theater. Surprisingly, it was a decent crowd with mainly couples. The beginning was o'k , the ending was pretty good but the middle was absolutely borrrring!!!! It will almost put you to sleep. There was no chemistry , no character development and not much going on. Unlike the first two , Mike had rapport with his dance partners , this one had nothing. The dance partners were too old to be a stripping act so that would not work, but they could have come up with something better. This will probably be the end of this one, as I'm assuming this is going to get a thumbs down - all the way around.",4/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"Magic Mike stands on bare ground again, after losing his furniture business during the pandemic. He's bartending at a charity event when he meets Maxandra Mendoza (Salma Hayek), a separated, jet-setting socialite.It dawns on Max that Mike has a past of - ahem - dancing. She tells him to make a comeback! Pays well.Around 10 minutes into ""Magic Mike's Last Dance"", Mike mounts Max (both are clothed, must know), and starts to peck at her, like a dog, primarily in the face and crotch region. The situation is comical and erotic (depends on who's watching), and also a reminder of how little sex there is to see in mainstream American films these days.The film will never be so lively again. Max sees the light of some kind, and asks Mike to come with her to Britain. This condo in Miami? Phew! Just a simple secondary residence! Wait until you see the one in London! With its own butler and all! Again: Pays well.To illustrate that ""Magic Mike's Last Dance"" is now moving from the US to England, Soderbergh chooses to film a pile of objects in a souvenir shop (small Paddington Bears, red double-deckers). All the most classic London clichés - under one roof! Time and money saved! It's so limp it's hard to believe, and it says everything about what the director thinks about us viewers: That we're idiots who don't deserve better.What is it that Max wants with Mike in England? No more sex, actually. Not at first, anyway. No; The plan is to get revenge on the ex-husband in a much more sinister way.Maxandra manages a hitherto venerable theatre, The Rattigan, which has been in her ex-husband's family for generations. Now she wants to put on a striptease show there to compromise and humiliate him! That'll teach him!From here on out, ""Magic Mike's Last Dance"" proceeds like an Elvis Presley movie from the 1960s, only dumber. Max and Mike have the pleasure of testing out a series of talents drawn from the streets of London and the European continent. They have to overcome a couple of obstacles on the way, among them a gray mouse of a female bureaucrat who can certainly be ""coaxed"" into reason....
Reid Carolin's screenplay has to be one of the weakest ever made into a film by a highly respected director. The plot could have been dreamed up by an 11-year-old on order from The Disney Channel. The dialogues are painfully stupid. The characters are flat, even unsympathetic. I mean, this Max is a horrible, spoiled person.Tatum is cool, and can dance. But his director displays an at best mediocre flair for capturing movement and choreography on camera. So not much to pick up there either.Towards the end, ""Magic Mike's Last Dance"" becomes downright bizarre. Before the final half-hour's shockingly tame Chippendales show (No PG needed), Soderbergh inserts an intermission poster(!) possibly to emphasize how stupid he thinks all this is, and how little he cares.Next, he leaves half of the scene to a woman (Juliette Motamed) we have barely met, and in no way cares about, and asks her to spout off a bunch of extremely transparent, quasi-feminist platitudes about ""liberation"".Most incomprehensible of all: He asks Tatum to do the climactic dance with a woman other than Maxandra (namely Kylie Shea). What???The effect is as satisfying as interrupted intercourse, and puts two red lines under what we've known for almost two hours already: That ""Magic Mike's Last Dance"" is an embarrassment for everyone involved, embarrassing for every imaginable gender and by a wide margin the worst , the most alarmingly amateur film Steven Soderbergh has put his name on.The director has always been concerned with his versatility. Well, congratulations: He can now add pure rubbish to his CV.",1/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"One of the worst movies I've ever seen! I loved Magic Mike 1 & 2. The story line was horrible! Selma Hayik's acting and clothing were just plain frumpy. There was NO and I mean NO chemistry between Channing and Selma. She was such a disturbed character. I didn't go to see some stupid story about her and it takes place in England. You see 4 of the former characters from the first two movies for less than five minutes on a video call and then you never see those guys again! The new guys you never get to know, most of its Selma's character ranting and raving. There's really no comedy in it. The single dance in the movie by one of the guys was epic, he and his dancing were amazing. The men were good looking and talented dancers but put on more of an off broadway show than the stripping that we go to see in the Magic Mike movies. Channing's dance at the end of the movie with a beautiful ballerina was by far the best thing in the entire movie. It was HER that we were watching closer than Channing because she was so elegant. I would have preferred to just watch those two dance through the entire movie and no one say a word!",1/10

Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"Safe to say this is the worst Magic Mike movie. It's boring more often than not and plays it way too safe. Women are more naked in a burlesque show than these men were. Why exactly is this rated R? Today's music videos are more R-rated than this. I would say the most entertaining scene was the lap dance Channing Tatum gives Salma Hayek but other than that most of the movie is just her whining about the show they're going to put on and when the show finally comes it's not nearly as exciting as it should be. I know plenty will say it but I'd rather this movie had been a Step Up movie and them just left Magic Mike at the sequel. Compared to the other two it was just an unfun ride. Also on a side note when she's going through the different types of men that ""women want"" a CEO that pays women more than men? I thought the goal was to be equal allegedly? And how about a man with a puppy! Men have dogs all the time how about a man that puts the seat down or does the dishes. Anyway unlike the other two I'll never see this one again.",3/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"I sat through the entire credits, sure that's we'd seen what we came to see - the old gang dancing together again (or at least face to face again), and Mike dancing to Pony.NOPE.The only time we saw the old gang was a 3-minute FaceTime with a ""poor connection"". Tarzan and Richie had maybe one line each. None of the new dancers even had names.THE WORST PART? There was what, 7 seconds of Pony - and Mike didn't dance to it. It wasn't even in the credits. Give a girl something!!The Salma/London storyline seemed unnecessary. There was so much (boring) story and not nearly enough of what this made this franchise what it was: male strippers.I did love that the final show scenes were basically a nod to the Magic Mike Vegas show (yes, I've been).

Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"Channing Is still an incredibly talented however This one has a completely different vibe to magic Mike and magic Mike xxl , the plot felt very meh and despite the dancers being very talented there was a lack of any personality from them we really didn't get to know them at all , it really needed characters like Dallas Tarzan and big dick Richie. Making magic Mikes last dance more mature and thoughtful hasn't really worked the dancing and stripping is a lot tamer it's no where as sexy or as entertaining as the previous films in the franchise.mikes last dance scene was wow but even this isn't enough to save the entire film . Overall it's a slow burner that doesn't feel authentic to the original movie I think there were betters ways to have shown Mike had matured and no longer strips ,replaced the gyrating and air humping for modern expressive dance and ballet .

Anyways I'm sure this will get mixed reviews/opinions cause it's more of a drama than a comedy with a few funny parts and some frustrating bits if that's voided out its great experience. Plenty of excitement, beautiful cinematography, loads of sexiness, and charm! Channing Tatum and Salma Hayek are exceptional together along the rest of the incredible cast. As much the film has some flaws its better the previous one I would say Steven Soderbergh is a great director I especially love his older films.",7/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),3.5 out of 5 stars.Magic Mike Last Dance is a pretty fair comedy drama film which may lack the fun the other films had but does go in a new direction that will probably divide the fans. I overall enjoyed the new direction. It may be playing it safe with less of male strippers. And more of Channing Tatum and Salma Hayek forming a relationship. And Tatum trying to help her form a dance performance. The plot is good with its new direction. The cast is good. Salma Hayek is a fun new addition to the series. The script's narrative structure is cheesy. The film may also lack the fun the other films had. The dance sequences are creative and entertaining.,7/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"SCORE: 5.3/10My disappointment is immeasurable. A movie like this is a perfect example of the danger of trying to be very different with a sequel or a third movie. In some cases, a stand alone movie is so good that there is no need for a sequel. That was not the case with Magic Mike. Magic Mike XXL was one of the best sequels I've ever seen, as the first one introduced an interesting concept but wasn't anything special and XXL brought new life to the story. The third one was perfectly set up to play off the success of XXL, however it tried to do something super different, bringing stripping to theater and giving it a more serious tone. But, now it makes sense. They went back to the same Director, Stephen Soderbergh, that directed the original, which also lacked a compelling story.It started off so well. The woman noticing Mike at the bar from her experience with him as a ""Police Officer"" and the dance he gave Max were setting up an incredible story. Unfortunately, after the beginning, it began to feel like a ""well this can happen, and then this, and than that and, oh that could be cool"" type of story telling. It's almost like they completely lost focus and control of the story once they made their way to London. Selma Hayek was a very interesting casting, as she does embody female empowerment and has an unbelievable presence, but her character felt extremely flat, whether by her performance or the way her character was written. Her character just felt disinterested, which led to a lack of chemistry with Mike. The idea of Max traveling to London on a quest to make other women feel the way she did was so awesome, but they went about it in an unconventional and complicated way, making that premise miss big time. It was all way too rushed.At the end, it felt like the storytellers hit the panic button and thought to themselves ""oh, wait we have to finish this"" and completely rushed through it all. The inclusion of Pony as the final song felt like an afterthought, especially given it wasn't even Mike performing it. How do you make a movie called Magic Mike's Last Dance and not cap it off with his most iconic song? They even teased it when Max's daughter was told to leave until the end of Pony, as if he was going to be the one to perform it. The lack of chemistry between Mike and Max led to an awkward, almost cringe-worthy final scene that had no heart. I probably shouldn't care this much, but one of my biggest cinema/film pet peeves is when they don't respect and capitalize on the success that the movies before it brought. Save being different for a brand new project, and give the fans what they want to see. Introduce new concepts, but don't completely drown out what we know and love.To end on a positive note, this film still had its moments, mostly because Channing Tatum delivered another amazing performance. Some of it was funny, I enjoyed a few of the fresh ideas introduced, including getting Hannah's character more involved, and it still had some entertaining parts, like the bus dance for Edna. It may be impossible to make a 4th movie given that the title of this one was ""Magic Mike's Last Dance"", but I need another one in order to fix the damage done. This can't be how Mike goes out!",5/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),I went to this movie to have some escapist entertainment . The film delivers on that front for the most part. The dance sequences are sexy and exciting but the storyline is pretty pedestrian and the two leads do not really create a believable relationship. The first dance between the two stars is very hot but following that the dialogue between them is boring and hard to follow.I feel the film projects a healthy eroticism which I appreciated .I think the film could have benefited from more dancing and better character development.To sum up the film is fun and sexy. Its not a bad way to spend a couple hours though it is disappointing in some respects.,7/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"I went to see this film with my family. This movie almost commits the unpardonable sin of being dull.This time ""Magic"" Mike is a bartender at a wealthy woman's mansion in Miami. After giving her a lap dance, she invites Mike to visit England and turn her ex-husband's theater into a burlesque show. She wants revenge on her husband and thinks this will be sweet vengeance. Why? Who knows, and by the time the film is over, who cares?The problem with this movie is it is cold and emotionless.The bigger problem is there is no chemistry between Salma Hayek and Channing Tatum. That ruins the film.The idea that Salma wants revenge on her husband by turning the upper-crust theater owned by her husband makes me think that this movie would have been better with Joan Collins as the female lead. Is Magic Mike: The Last Dance the film Joan Collins never starred in?",3/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"Let's face it. We've all come to see ""Magic Mike's Last Dance"" to watch the handsome Channing Tatum do the ""Pony"" one last time. We didn't want to hear any soppy narration about love, or watch Salma Hayek's mid-life crisis. I know we're in the matriarchy era, but the female characters felt pretty forced.I really don't know why the dances felt so boring and bland, some of them really making me cringe. In my opinion, the best one out all of them was the ""dancing in the rain"" scene.The performances were alright, keeping in mind the material they've got. The cinematography wasn't anything fabulous, and the filming techniques we're not creative at all, in comparison with the first movie, let's say, where you felt like you were right there ,in the strip club, smelling the sweat and testosterone of the dancers. The soundtrack wasn't great either, trying to appeal new generations, but somewhat miserably failing. The ending was unclimactic, and left me wondering what I could've done with the time and money I've wasted on this.Don't get me wrong, I was a hardcore Magic Mike fan and still am, but I simply choose not acknowledge the existence of this last movie, in which Channing Tatum hasn't EVEN done the ""Pony"" once...",5/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"Somehow they chose to add a complicated plot to a strip movie but the execution is just terrible. The whole script feels like it's written in the shortest time possible, the cinematography is just plain boring, there's no music or soundtrack throughout the whole movie (except when there's dancing, but the music choice is still terrible) and to tie it all together there's no chemistry between characters or any character building at all (I blame bad direction for a big part of this). Which is sad, because I feel like there's so much wasted potential here. Just with a few more interesting shots, a story that's a little better tied together and some background music to set the tone, I feel like the movie would be a thousand times better already. They could've just left the whole plot out and just have sexy guys dancing around for the whole movie and hell, that would be a 100 times better already. This was definitely the worst movie I've seen for the past two years!",1/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"Three quarters of the way through the film, an intermission sign pops up, featuring some kittens. Not in a Fight Club (breaking the third wall way), or a Titanic (this film is so long you'll literally need a toilet break) way. It's not telegraphed, or explained, it just happens. We had to ask afterward if it was a mistake by the cinema and they assured us it was not. It was the only three seconds of the film that was truly enjoyable.The rest of the runtime was built around one interesting idea someone had to have Channing Tatum dance on a water covered stage. Except, nobody cared how they got there or why. Nobody cared about story, logic, dialogue, acting... None of it. This may legitimately be the worst film I've ever seen, and I've seen 2009's Dragonquest.Save your money and don't watch this.",1/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"Sorry ladies... save your $12 and watch Magic Mike (2012) at home.With the theater filled with mostly fellow middle-aged women remembering how amazing Magic Mike was, I'd give The Last Dance a 2 star at MOST. Those 2 stars come solely from the first 5 minutes of the movie. The cast was made up of fit and talented men, all of whom look like they're in their early 20's. They didn't hold a candle to the 2012 crew! From the music to the dance crew choices, this movie was a huge letdown 😭. There is no doubt Channing Tatum still has sex appeal, I'll always be a fan, but I'm giving this one a thumbs down.",2/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"In true Magic Mike fashion, the dancing was great but the rest of the story left much to be desired.I have several critiques of this film that I almost don't even want to share because I think the writers know that they put little effort into the story line. They know they're going to get views regardless because of the hot half naked dancers.But I'll share anyways. The two lead actors had absolutely ZERO chemistry on screen. How do you *not* have chemistry with Channing?? He had more chemistry with the ballerina he dances with at the end (who has no dialogue) than he does with the female lead.Secondly, the dialoque is horrendous. I don't even need to go further into that.Thirdly, they had this super awkward and uncomfortable teenager narrating the movie as if it was some sort of romance-based dancing movie rather than literally a stripper movie. She's apparently writing a novel about dancing and she narrates that at super random times in the background and it's so unnecessary and completely changes the feel of the film which if you know what you came for, doesn't make sense at all. Almost felt like National Geographic haha!Lastly, there was a point during the final performance where they dubbed over the actual music and put a different song in the background than what they were actually dancing to...so the dance looked really off tone and off beat and I just don't understand why they did that.Worth adding: there's a dancing scene on a bus that I thought was going to be really cool, like the one from Step Up 2, the Streets. But it was just too short and ended really abruptly which was a huge bummer. Actually throughout the film there was SO MANY LULLS in the story where I was just waiting for the dancing again. That's what we came for but they instead provided extremely droning filler with an awful story line full of plot holes.",4/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"Magic Mike's Last Dance is a very different film to what's come before in this franchise, both for better and for worse but this gender swapped Pretty Woman is still a really good conclusion to the trilogy with a fun and pleasantly charming film that gives its title character the swan song he deserves.3 films in and 8 years later Channing Tatum has undoubtedly still got it with a ridiculously impressive fluidity to his movement and a fiery chemistry with Salma Hayek Pinault, who brings a kindness and slightly understated nature compared to her usual roles which makes the louder moments work better.Steven Soderbergh's direction is really good despite an overbearing voice over, leaving the majority of the visual flourishes and style for a big third act blowout that really impresses and it's early moments are a reminder that Hollywood films had really forgotten how to be sexy.",7/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"Despite its threadbare storyline this third instalment of the Magic Mike story is fairly watchable, almost entirely due to the charisma of Channing Tatum. Salma Hayek is clearly slumming but she throws herself into it much as when she played the vampire dancer in Tarantino's FROM DUSK TO DAWN.Steven Soderbergh, who directed this and the first of the trilogy but not the second, is also slumming but he gives the movie plenty of pace and pizzazz. None of the new troupe of dancers gets a decent back story, and the show-stopping finale amounts to no more than a series of raunchy Madonna-style music videos. Nobody actually goes 'the Full Monty', which feels like a rip-off. The opening scene, in which Sayek purchases a sensational private dance from Tatum, is the highlight not only of this episode but of the entire series - and probably worth the price of admission.",6/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"I'll admit I've never watch the first two Magic Mike films, but after seeing this I guess I wasn't missing much. I took interest in this film cause Salma Hayek is in this, and she always seems to make anything better, but does she here, not quite.Now don't get me wrong, Channing Tatum and Salma Hayek have proving that they very talented actors, and shown that they are more than just pretty faces. But they just don't click with each other, I felt Tatum had better chemistry with Sandra Bullock in The Lost City. Nothing for me really jumps out, the acting is null and void. Two new characters are amusing, but really serve no purpose here. Now dance scenes are okay, but the rest of the movie is not.",4/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"Greetings, my fellow film enthusiasts. It's time to crack open a cold one and dive headfirst into the world of Magic Mike's Last Dance. Buckle up, folks, because we're in for a bumpy ride.Let's start with the positives, shall we? The feminist edge to the story is a breath of fresh air. It's great to see female characters taking the lead in a traditionally male-dominated genre. The chemistry between Channing Tatum and Salma Hayek is undeniable, and they make for a compelling on-screen duo. The movie's opening scene is also quite the seduction, leaving viewers wanting more. It's a great way to hook in the audience.However, this is where the praise ends. Unfortunately, Magic Mike's Last Dance is nothing but a cash grab that lacks purpose and direction. The film fails to capture the raw, seductive energy of its predecessor, leaving audiences underwhelmed. The characters are flat, and the plot is meandering, which makes it feel like the filmmakers didn't have a clear idea of where they were taking the story.Furthermore, the movie's attempt at humor falls flat, with jokes that often feel forced or just plain cringe-worthy. It's like they were trying too hard to recapture the lightning in a bottle that was the original Magic Mike, and it just didn't work. In the end, the film feels like a cheap imitation of its former self.In conclusion, Magic Mike's Last Dance is a disappointing sequel that fails to live up to its predecessor. While the feminist edge and chemistry between the leads are commendable, the lack of direction, flat characters, and forced humor make it a forgettable film. Save your money and watch the original instead.",4/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"Oh man, what an awful, awful movie. Please do not waste your money and see this in the theater. Definitely worth a rental at home, and just fast forward to two parts: (1) The incredible dancing of the Italian ballet dancer about midway through, and (2) Literally the end of the movie for the two dance routines.The opening solo dance Channing Tatum does for (and all over) Selma Hayek is extremely hot, but also *very* cringey, and literally turns him into a hooker. The only time any of the old crew appears is in a 2 minute cameo via a constantly freezing Zoom call that apparently had less reception than two tin cans and a piece of string.This was almost puzzlingly bad. Absolutely zero chemistry between literally anyone in this film other than the final dance; a plot that made absolutely NO sense; moronic dialogue; the 100% unnecessary narrative that Selma Hayek's 11-year-old daughter gives MULTIPLE times over sexual material (?!?!); a slew of little subplots that were meaningless and cluttered up the already ridiculous main plot; the world's weirdest, and again 100% unnecessary, INTERMISSION KITTEN POSTER thrown into the film for a moment (Soderbergh just laughing at this disaster of a movie??); an unhinged leading lady; and sadly, very, very little dancing.What a terrible mess. Laughably bad, and such a disappointment. The Magic Mike trilogy went out not with a bang (other than the for-hire bangs), but with an unintelligible whisper.",1/10
Magic Mike's Last Dance (2023),"Never saw one of these movies, got invited by a neighbor. The dialogue was so inane that I couldn't even follow the story or figure out what it was about. The dancing must have been at the end because I didn't see much, but I left about half way through, couldn't take anymore. Both stars basically mailed their performances in and I couldn't figure out who the supporting actors were or what their purposes were in this movie. I'm still trying to figure out what little dialogue I was able to pick out and what it had to do with the story line.

Kylie plays a female dancer that helps Channing show off his dancing skills.

Ant-Man (2015),"Ant-Man is an extremely fun origin story and a superb addition to the MCU. Paul Rudd is incredibly charming in the lead role with Evangeline Lilly, Michael Douglas and Michael Peña giving great supporting performances.

Unfortunately, it does suffer from the weak villain problem that some other Marvel movies suffer from.",9/10
Ant-Man (2015),"ANT-MAN is another light and breezy Marvel superhero movie conceived as a stand-alone introductory piece. The story is about a down-on-his-luck thief who ends up stealing a body suit that has the power to miniaturise him instantly. He then uses said suit to go on a heist to retrieve some important technology from a maniac. The film is set in the same universe as the Avengers films and contains some clumsily shoehorned-in references to the franchise.It's a simple enough conceit, but one which zings with humour and features endlessly great CGI action sequences which really push the boundaries and show off techniques and effects that haven't been done before. It was a lot of fun seeing ants playing the good guys in a similar way to HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS. The heist plot is nothing special but there's enough ensemble acting and humour to see it through. I wasn't particularly interested in Paul Rudd's hero, but Michael Douglas gives reliable support and Corey Stoll's bad guy is memorably nasty. For a light-hearted effects blockbuster, ANT-MAN works a treat.",7/10
Ant-Man (2015),"Having enjoyed a vast majority of Marvel's superhero output (more so than most) without worshipping them, 'Ant-Man' is a minor effort from them but there is still a good amount to like about it.'Ant-Man' manages to be a better film than expected. The character is not exactly a household name and is always tossed aside in favour of other superhero characters like Spiderman that have had longer longevity and perhaps have more compelling origins and stories, hence why they are adapted more. Also wasn't sure what to make of the trailer, which made the film out to be rather bland and too reliant on humour.Seeing it for myself finally a year on, 'Ant-Man' could have been better. While the humour mostly works wonders, there are a few instances where it's not so funny and not very well placed, like in emotional scenes that are actually quite poignant and then interrupted by a joke that is not only forced and unfunny but also not belonging in the scene. The family scenes are a mixed bag, sometimes they are sweet and touching while at other times they're a little flat and predictable, contributing towards a few rare dull stretches. Corey Stoll also goes through the motions as the rather generic and under-characterised villain.On the other hand, 'Ant-Man' is a great looking film, it's beautifully shot, very atmospheric, is very slick and the special effects, mostly the rapid size-changing and with the ants, are clever and of the usual high-quality Marvel standards. The music avoids being over-bearing, one-note, too quirky or too bombastic, fitting well tone, mood and pace-wise. Direction is more than competent, keeping the story going at a solid pace and the telling of it interesting enough, though maybe a little more flavour may have been more welcome. While the action is not as much as most Marvel films, it is fun, thrilling, nicely choreographed and tautly shot and edited, especially towards the end. Admittedly there are a couple of cheesy parts towards the end too, but kind of in an endearing rather than jarring way and it doesn't jar with the rest of the film.There is some very smart and hugely entertaining scripting and dialogue here in 'Ant-Man' too. While it doesn't work completely seamlessly, 'Ant-Man' is one of Marvel's generally consistently funniest films, and the film doesn't take itself too seriously or too much of a joke either, instead not being afraid to embrace the silliness and humour while ensuring still that the subject matter is treated with respect. It is especially good with the title character's deadpan quips and Luis' fast-talking patter. The story is mostly diverting, it's narratively simpler than most Marvel outings and less risks here are taken than most Marvel films but it always makes sense, moments of dullness and jarring are few (while not being completely absent either), it's fun and it doesn't try to do too much or try to insert too many characters while not playing things too safe either.While not complex as such, the characters are mostly engaging and are not too one-dimensional, only the villain could have had more done with him. Paul Rudd is a strong and hugely entertaining lead, while Michael Peña's hilarious in a role that could have been really annoying. The seasoned support of Michael Douglas adds hugely too, and Evangeline Lilly gives the film some much needed heart. Anthony Mackie is good too.Overall, minor Marvel but good Marvel. Well-made and a lot of fun, but there is a personal preference to the Marvel films that took bigger risks with more and often richer characters, bigger bolder action and more going on in the story. 'Ant-Man' executes a vast majority of its components really well indeed, just that Marvel has done even better before and since. 7/10 Bethany Cox",7/10

Ant-Man (2015),"This is one of those MCU movies that are great but aren't that important in the overall plot of the MCU. Paul Rudd is great in this role. His personality really fit the character.

Ant-Man (2015),"OK, so I will probably target the wrath of a legion of fan-boys but as a PhD Physicist I will categorically state that much of the science in the Marvel universe is total nonsense. For example, it requires a certain suspension of belief that whole cities can be levitated. But it's called ""Science Fiction"" for a reason, right? ""Ant Man"" pushes that suspension of belief to whole new levels. The concept that a miniaturised man, were such a thing even possible, could exert the same moment and force as a full sized person would make Newton spin in his grave.With these nagging doubts I watched the trailer increasingly comfortable in my view that, (even with a free cinema pass), this was a film I would avoid like the plague. That was until the final scene, featuring Thomas the Tank engine, that was ludicrously and surprisingly comical. Could it be that, like last year's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"", Marvel had pulled its pompous head out of its ass and come up with an 'Avengers-lite' that could entertain a broader audience? I decided to risk it. And I was glad I did.Paul Rudd (""Friends"", ""Anchorman"") plays ex-con Scott Lang who is recruited by brilliant scientist and would-be superhero Dr Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) and his gorgeous daughter Hope (""Lost"" and ""The Hobbit""'s Evangeline Lilly) to steal a jacket. (No, really). The owner of said jacket, albeit a high-tech jacket, is businessman and all-round bad-guy Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), with evil intent. (You can tell he's evil by what he does to a cute little lamb - this is the worst viewing for sheep since ""Far from the Madding Crowd"".) By miniaturising Lang and securing the help of an army of ants, the stage is set for a heist of a most unusual kind.This sounds ridiculous to even write. So why does it work? First up, the script by Edgar Wright ( of ""3 Flavours Cornetto"" fame), Adam McKay (""The Other Guys""), Joe Cornish and Paul Rudd himself is as tight as a drum, with some situations and lines that are downright hilarious. A couple of brilliant lip sync scenes, one featuring the requisite Stan Lee cameo, are grin-inducing pleasures.Supporting the screenplay, the three leading players pull off their roles with enormous panache. Rudd is hugely likable, with all of the smart-whip humour of Downey Jnr.'s ""Iron Man"" but with none of the appalling arrogance. Michael Douglas, in his one outing this year, seems to be revelling in his role and (presumably with the help of some clever makeup and/or CGI) looking very dapper in the 1987 version of his character. And Evangeline Lilly enters the Avenger's world with a bang and looks very comfortable there. In an effective supporting role, Michael Peña (""American Hustle"") adds a comic lightness of touch as fellow robber Luis. Abby Ryder Fortson also deserves special mention (and an Oscar for cuteness) as Lang's young daughter.Whilst real fan-boys might object to the flippant nature of the film, there are a number of clever cross-overs into the 'mainstream' ""Avengers"" films, with one B-list Avenger guest star and (eventually) an A-list appearance. And (as is common in these films, and notable as 80% of the audience stayed in their seats for the full credits) there is both a mid-credits scene (that's a set-up for the sequel) and a final post-credit scene that (so I'd told) is hugely significant for next year's ""Captain America: Civil War"" (in which Rudd is set to reprise his ""Ant Man"" role).The director is Peyton Reed, whose limited movie portfolio to date includes Jim Carrey's ""Yes Man"" and ""Bring it On"".As I found myself thoroughly enjoying the experience, my rating, against all the odds, is twice what I expected it to be. I can't believe I'm saying this but I recommend you go see this for a fun movie summer experience.",8/10
Ant-Man (2015),"After three years in prison cat burglar Scott Lang finds it difficult to find work so soon gets involved in a robbery. His criminal contacts have learnt about an old man with a massive safe in his basement they don't know what it contains but given the security it must be valuable. He is rather surprised to discover that all it contains is what looks like an old biker-suit. He takes it and tries it on later suddenly he shrinks to the size of an ant! It turns out the suit's owner, Dr Hank Pym, intended for him to steal it he wants somebody who is a skilled burglar to use the suit for a very specific job. Initially Scott isn't interested but inevitably he is soon pulled in. Hank explains how the suit works and tells Scott that he is worried because his former protégé Darren Cross has replicated the technology and intends to sell it to the highest bidder. Scott won't be working alone; he will have support from Hank, his daughter Hope, his three criminal friends and lots of ants it turns out Dr Pym has developed technology that enables ants to be telepathically controlled! Ultimately Scott, in his Ant-Man suit will have to face Cross who is wearing his fully armed 'Yellowjacket' suit.Not being a comic reader I wasn't familiar with Ant-Man before this film came out but when heard about it I thought the premise sounded rather fun and so it is. There are some humorous moments, mostly provided by Scott's criminal friends; these are fun and don't detract from the story. Scott/Ant-Man is a good protagonist as he isn't a typical superhero; he has no natural superpowers and the technology he uses wasn't invented by himself. Paul Rudd does a fine job in the role and is ably supported by Michael Douglas and Evangeline Lilly as Dr Pym and Hope. Corey Stoll is suitably menacing as Cross and Michael Peña, Tip ""T.I."" Harris and David Dastmalchian are fun as Scott's criminal friends. The special effects are very impressive making it easy to suspend ones disbelief and accept that Ant-Man can change size and interact with actual ants. I liked the fact that while it is made clear that this film takes place in the same reality as other Marvell superhero films it doesn't guest star any other well-known superheroes just one less well known one in a scene where Ant-Man infiltrates an Avengers facility to steal a needed piece of equipment. Overall I'd certainly recommend this to fans of the superhero genre; it is lots of fun and has plenty of exciting moments.",8/10

Ant-Man (2015),"I went into this flick not expecting much. I'm not an Ant Man fan so I was not waiting in anticipation for this as much as I wanted to see Age of Ultron.The character that Paul Rudd plays in this movie is not the Ant Man I wanted to see, and Micheal Douglas' role as Hank Pym, the original Ant man only made me want to see him dawn the suit even more, cause Micheal Douglas was everything a superhero should be in this movie, Charming, really good dialog, and ready for action. Overall, Ant Man surprised me. It was one of the more unique superhero movies out. Ant Man did things far beyond just punching and kicking that a lot of superheroes are doing on the big screen and went places no other super hero could go making for an action packed adventure. As cool as Ant Man was when he was regular size beating up the bad guys, was as good as when he was shrunken, riding and controlling ants in a world only he can go to.The villain Darren Cross was actually pretty good too. Not as good as Loki, but just as psycho. Once again, not an Ant Man fan but this movie is changing my mind. I'm so impressed with what Paul Rudd did with the character. Not only that, but it's a great Marvel comic movie, in how it intertwines with the whole Marvel cinematic Universe.Definitely recommend seeing in 3D cause it's that type of movie that deserves it.",9/10
Ant-Man (2015),"By far the most underrated Marvel film ever made, Ant-Man is an incredibly fun little action flick that will make you smile from ear to ear. No drama, no bs, Ant-Man's pure focus is to bring a good time to the audience- and it truly succeeds. Between the fun visual gags, quirky sense of humor, and Rudd's charming antics- there is very little do dislike about this movie. The only flaw I really have with the film is the villain. Corey Stoll certainly tries his best in his role as Darren Cross, but it can often be a little too much at times, and his character itself feels rather thinly written- obviously to only serve the purpose of being the films antagonist. That all being said, the yellowjacket suit in the film is incredibly well done, and obviously the Ant-Man suit is perfect as well. Besides Stoll, I truly did enjoy all the performances at hand. Rudd is the obvious standout, capturing his signature charm into a peculiar hero I don't think I could ever get tired of. We also have the great Michael Douglas in a great supporting role, as well as Evangeline Lilly and Michael Pena as our other standouts. The film is incredibly entertaining from start to finish. It's almost two hours long, but you'll feel like you'll want more once the credits role, and even more after. In the end, Ant-Man is a criminally underrated little superhero flick (no pun intended) and just may be one of the MCU's best.My Rating: 9.6/10.",10/10
Ant-Man (2015),"For a few brief moments, the unstoppable juggernaut that is the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) looked like it was about to grind to a halt with Ant-Man. Unlike most other films under the Marvel Studios umbrella, this production has been haunted by doubt and dissension. Fans were nervous about the narrative decisions to relegate Hank Pym – the original Ant-Man in the comic books – to the sidelines, while killing off his wife Janet Van Dyne (who, as the Wasp, is one of the founding members of the Avengers). Then came that hugely publicised parting of the ways between Marvel and original director Edgar Wright, who oozes so much geek cred that people understandably mourned his departure from the project after years of development. And yet, the final product – Peyton Reed's Ant-Man – is a fun, frothy delight, one that proves once and for all that Marvel knows precisely what it's doing and where it's going with the most crazily interconnected movie-and-television franchise of all time.After serving his jail sentence, Scott Lang (Rudd) just wants to reunite with his daughter Cassie and get his life back on track. But he soon discovers that people in the outside world – including his ex- wife Maggie (Greer) and her new cop boyfriend Paxton (Cannavale) – aren't particularly kind to former convicts. Beaten down by circumstances, he agrees to pull off one last heist with his eternally optimistic buddy Luis (Pena). It's a crime that places him squarely in the path of Dr. Hank Pym (Douglas), a retired, semi-reclusive scientist who decides to enlist Scott in his life-long mission of preventing the Pym Particle – a technological breakthrough that allows him to become the super- small, super-strong Ant-Man – from falling into the wrong hands.Truth be told, Ant-Man gets off to a somewhat shaky start. The tale of an honourable rogue who's looking for a shot at redemption is a well-worn storytelling trope, one that the film initially seems to embrace rather too eagerly. As we watch Scott soldier through a host of tiny indignities, the dialogue – still credited to Wright and his co-writer Joe Cornish, with rewrites by Rudd and Adam McKay – is uninspired, and oftentimes uncomfortably on-the-nose. There's no subtlety here, and the sense of fun that accompanies Scott's attempt to hold down a job in Baskin Robbins feels a wee bit forced.But the film kicks into higher gear, and stays there, once Scott stumbles onto or, more accurately, steals his second chance. His discovery of the Ant-Man suit and all that entails – working with Hank, meeting Hank's aloof but eminently capable daughter Hope (Lilly), training to prevent Hank's former protégé Darren Cross (Stoll) from replicating the Pym Particle for sale to the highest bidder – give the story the shot of adrenaline it needs. In the blink of an eye, this superhero heist flick finds its feet, and transforms into a whirlwind of action, humour and heart. Reed's camera zigs merrily from Luis' unique method of exposition (brilliant) to Scott's attempts to survive Hope's training (bruisingly hilarious), before zagging into the dark, trembling heart of Hank's troubled relationship with his daughter.Indeed, what makes Ant-Man work so well is its insistence on respecting its characters and taking their concerns and relationships seriously. This provides the film with an emotional anchor amidst all the madcap chaos and gleeful irreverence. Scott's overpowering love for his young daughter runs parallel to Hank's own concern for Hope, and even Paxton – initially caricaturised as the stereotypical brutish new boyfriend – is given layers and depth beyond what might be expected of a film that seems so silly on the surface. This culminates in the film's best action sequence: one that manages to be utterly ridiculous, as the camera cheekily zooms in and out of a conflict that's entirely proportional to the size of its participants; but also deeply heartfelt, when Scott makes a split-second decision between life and probable death. For anyone concerned about Ant-Man subsisting in its own little bubble within the MCU, rest assured that there's plenty on display here to please even the most die-hard of fans. The film features not only a welcome cameo from a very popular agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., but also ties Scott firmly into MCU continuity with a hugely pleasing direct reference to Avengers: Age Of Ultron. The subsequent semi-aerial battle that takes place between Ant-Man and a certain Avenger proves that this miniscule hero has what it takes to stand proud alongside the world's mightiest champions. (Stay through the credits, by the way, for two incredibly exciting hints at what's to come for the MCU in the future.)As with all the other films and television shows in Marvel's burgeoning media empire, the cast of Ant-Man is pitch-perfect. Rudd puts his goofy and amiably sexy charisma to excellent use as Scott, allowing us to believe that this one man can be as silly as he is strong, and as serious as he is funny. Lilly gets the big-screen role she richly deserves in Hope, who's acknowledged at every point in the film as being better, stronger, and more capable than the men around her think she is. Douglas plays a far more palatable version of Dr. Pym (who can be tough to swallow in the comics), and does so with his trademark charm and magnetism, while Stoll gives good psychopath as the increasingly unhinged, patently cruel Cross.Ant-Man may not edge out the other films that make up Phase Two of the MCU in a straw poll – it does, after all, face some pretty serious competition in what has been an unbroken run of truly excellent superhero films. But it's an incredibly solid effort: smart, rich, deep and funny, teeming with ideas, genres and the potential for so much more. Now if that doesn't make for a great superhero movie, what does?",8/10
Ant-Man (2015),"Once again, there's a guy who needs to take over the world and side with a horrible group. He has money and fame and yet he has to go over to the dark side. In this case, he has taken previous research and molded it to his own devices. Michael Douglas first developed the ability to close up molecules and make things turn smaller with intense strength and capabilities. Then he loses his wife and drops from the scene. His right hand man, an ambitious jerk moves ahead and plots evil use of the findings. Paul Rudd plays a poor guy who is divorced. He was sent to prison for a burglary which had some unfair circumstances that led to unfair results. Pyn, Michael Douglas's character, realizes that he has to stop the next step or these bad guys will take over the world and brutalize it. Rudd becomes Ant-Man, not just because he can become small, but because he learns to run with the ants. Of course, the whole thing is high on the hokeyness meter, but, then, it is comic book stuff. It is fun and exciting and works pretty well. It leads to some pretty sappy results, but this is not Fellini or Bergman. It's a joyful effort, using the Marvel trademark.",8/10
Ant-Man (2015),"Antman. When I first heard about the plans for this movie I laughed to myself and thought, ""How can becoming smaller be cool?"" Sure enough, Marvel has surpassed my expectations and turned something I thought would be lame and uninteresting into something hilarious and actually pretty cool. I'm not going to include any spoilers, but I will say the fighting style of Antman is much better than I thought it would be. I learned a lot about the story as well as the abilities he has. Antman gets much more interesting when doing combat. The ability to shrink and grow at will is something Marvel has gotten very creative with. The language in this film is good enough for my young children to watch. There are no F or GD bombs to ruin the mood and the moment with the family. I'd say I'd surely watch it again.",8/10
Ant-Man (2015),"Ant-Man (2015) is my all time favorite MARVEL film it is my fourth favorite MARVEL film the first three are Captain America trilogy that I love to death while this movie stays right behind them. It is a fun and entertaining film and I have really enjoyed it, I don't have any problem with the film and I never really read the comic about Ant-Man, but watching this movie it is really solid super-hero movie. Ant-Man is MILES way better than Deadpool (2016) who get's so much praise for it! It is MILES way better than Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, X-Men Origins: Wolverine, The Wolverine, X-Men: Days of Future Past, X-Men: Apocalypse and Hulk (2003) those movies really sucked. Ant-Man (2015) is better than those movies that is just my opinion you even have a solid cast. I love that Ant-Man doesn't kill people and when they blow up the building no one is hurt, that makes him a superhero. I am a big fan of Michael Douglas and he does an excellent job as Hank Pym he was excellent. Paul Rudd as Scott Lang/Ant-Man was incredible. I mostly remember him from Friends when he played Mike, Phoebe's boyfriend and he make the movie with Jennifer Aniston also from Friends) The Object of My Affection (1998) he was terrific in Ant-Man. Evangeline Lilly from Lost and Real Steel is incredible excellent as Hope Pym who is Hank's daughter. Corey Stoll as Darren Cross / Yellowjacket was good at in his acting performance as the villain and last and at least Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson / Falcon was wonderful to see him in this movie I loved it.Plot: Armed with a super-suit with the astonishing ability to shrink in scale but increase in strength, cat burglar Scott Lang must embrace his inner hero and help his mentor, Dr. Hank Pym, plan and pull off a heist that will save the world. I love the film because it has a heart and it has a redemption, everyone deserves a second chance. It also has a strong message bonding estrange father and daughter together. Scott Lang is a former systems engineer at VistaCorp and petty criminal who acquires a suit that allows him to shrink in size but increase in strength. The movie is an origin story of the petty crook Scott Lang who comes into contact with a suit and does his best to make good, and then look at someone like Paul Rudd, who can do slightly unsavory things like break into people's houses and still be charming and who you root for and whose redemption you will find satisfaction in. He becomes Ant-Man and he is doing the right things for his daughter. He's ex wife throws him out while her new boyfriend is a cop pursuing Lang, he has one chance to make this right to be in his daughter's life. REDEMPTION.I have enjoy the visuals effects and the CGI was pretty good creating Ant-Man I didn't mind it. Checked Ant Man out again very fun entertaining comic book movie that didn't use the alien invasion angle, falling buildings or the world is gonna end, just a simple story, great visual effects and likable characters. The Ant-Man/Falcon fight was bad ass and I loved how Ant-Man defeated him. He saved his daughter Cassie and he showed that he is a good father. In the comics he used pills instead of discs to enlarge and shrink things. I think that was a good change they made. A final battle scene in the daughters bedroom on her Thomas Tank engine train track, imaginative an original and fun. Marvel's latest may not be their greatest achievement but yet another gamble for a character that is less then popular in that Universe. Adding the legendary Michael Douglas to the cast was pure genius much as Robert Redford played along in The Winter Soldier. The overall movie is fun and the execution of performances are fine but Ant-Man doesn't quite have the punch that I was expecting nor rank in the top five of all the Marvel films thus far. However the character should have a few solo efforts in the pipeline not to mention he's be seen in Civil War and most likely the next two Avenger Infinity War movies.The rating I give to this film is 10/10 it is my favorite MARVEL film I own it on Blu-ray disc and I enjoy it watching it, it is a pretty damn solid good movie at least for me.

Ant-Man (2015),"In my opinion, this is Marvel's first stab at something close to the comedy genre, and it does a good job with it. It's funny all the way through, it has some pretty horrifying scenes, and it includes a new set of characters fans can immediately fall in love with. There's nothing quite like a criminal becoming one of the most famous superheroes. Paul Rudd outdid himself introducing us to Ant-Man, and I'm really pleased with Marvel's choice to cast him. Michael Douglas plays a very good sarcastic, angry Hank Pym. There are a couple scenes that are a little mediocre, but they're not bad even then. The movie's paced well and has a sleuth of great moments, making it one of my favorite Marvel movies.",9/10
Ant-Man (2015),"Had it been too desperate and hopeless, ANT-MAN would have shrunk its way for admission to the almost-complete, Avengers team. But neither such concern nor saving the world from an impending catastrophic destruction, holds weight heavy enough to pull this miniature superhero from his top priority: winning back his daughter. The emotional weight of the narrative comes across as an anomalous content to the generally comedic structure of the film, but they serve purpose for the overall flow of the proceedings, nonetheless.The film follows Scott Lang (Paul Rudd), who has just been released from prison after committing burglary. He has been prohibited to see his daughter due to his inability to provide financial support, no thanks to his being an ex-con that keeps hindering him from getting a job. He meets the highly-intellectual yet solitary scientist, Hank Pym (Michael Douglas), who has a job for him: pulling off a heist on his ex-protégé, Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), who is in possession of a size-changing prototype, that poses massive amount of threats to worldwide security. Using a military suit that allows him to shrink back and forth, in size, Lang carries on with the mission with the hope that by doing so, he would be able to reclaim and earn the reputation and respect he lost, especially his daughter's.It's easier to see Ant-Man as a beautiful mess, rather than a well-crafted superhero flick with profound depth and sense . There's a lot of illogical nonsense that always nearly sends the film to wreckage, but there's also so much of the fun side to make up for the eventual narrative shortcoming. At the center of its comic efforts, Paul Rudd's Scott Lang/Ant-Man shines with his general amiability, pulling off his role with credible wit and comic allure. Rudd is such a delight here, and his presence and effortless take on his character make the mostly messed-up flow of the events, extremely palatable. There's also much to say about Michael Douglas, how his character, Pym, easily integrates well with Lang and his daughter, Hope (Evangeline Lily) , to provide a firm and well-knitted character framework. Corey Stoll, on the other hand, is less impressive, barely providing the needed threat to make his presence felt and his belligerence imminent. But on moments where he and Lang engage in beautifully-choreographed fight scenes, the ineptitude gets relegated below the more important aspects of the proceedings, and once it does, the breathtaking visual schemes work under the spotlight, capturing Lang's size-changing skill with epic elaborateness. There's magic in every size shift, and the visual artistry is at its peak to deliver the moment.Perhaps, one of the most immediately-noticeable difference of Ant-Man from its Marvel fellows is that it doesn't engage, nor rush too much, to explosive battles that generally results to immeasurable destruction. It is noticeably evident on the fact that its most interesting and most jaw-dropping action setpiece, happens in a toy train set. Most importantly, this new addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe places its comic prowess at the center of its general effort to validate its entry to the franchise, and that is achieved without putting the natural action/adventure tendency of its superhero, nor the inevitable emotional nature of its characters, at risk of getting overshadowed by the rudimentary elements of the narrative.It's actually hard to gauge ANT-MAN using the same measure that made the rest of its pack, mammoth and omnipotently powerful. But in its own right, and sub-atomic scale, this microscopic superhero is clearly a power behemoth, and it will surely spring back to its even bigger form, once the Avenger call is delivered.",8/10
Ant-Man (2015),"This reviewer wants to be like Paul Rudd when he turns 46. He first saw the New Jerseyborn actor on the popular sitcom Friends as Phoebe's love interest Mike Hannigan, and loved how he carried off the character with a slacker charm. He then went on to takes on roles in Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy (2004), The 40 Year Old Virgin (2005) and Knocked Up (2007). Although he played supporting characters in this comedies, there's always that special something which made viewers pay attention.And now, Rudd is Ant-Man! Yes, a Marvel superhero! If you are like this reader, who isn't a walking encyclopaedia of Marvel history, you probably haven't heard of Ant-Man. Who can take a superhero with a name like that seriously? Not us. Are you sure you need Ant-Man when you've already got Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye from The Avengers?One thing we are setting straight here – we enjoyed Ant-Man more than the recent The Avengers: Age of Ultron.The Peyton Reed directed movie, which is also the 12th installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (who's keeping count, really?), sees protagonist Scott Lang (Rudd) help Dr Hank Pym (the always reliable Michael Douglas) safeguard the mystery of a technology which allows users to decrease in size but increase in strength. In the movie, you will hear some scientifically complicated terms, but there isn't really much to know. You just need to be aware of the fact that there is a need to stop a heist that will destroy Earth,The threat comes in the form of Yellojacket, a thwarted version of the technology helmed by Darren Cross, and coming along for the ride is Dr Pym's daughter Hope van Dyne, and a motley crew of former thieves who will aid Lang save the world.The 117 minute movie is a very refreshing change from the slew of superhero movies we've been seeing. No overwrought emotions, no excessive self righteousness and no overbearingly dark tones. What you get instead, is a very likable protagonist (thanks to Rudd's appeal, of course) who is an everyman you want to root for. The result is a superhero movie that makes you sit up and watch, laugh and enjoy till the very last minute.Because it is backed up by a major studio, you can still expect the usual special effects, big explosions and well choreographed action sequences. These are enough to keep fans of Hollywoodblockbusters happy, and to have them feeling that the movie is well worth the price of the ticket.Credit goes to a wonderful ensemble cast, which includes Evangeline Lilly (The Hobbit series, TV's Lost) as the serious but well intending daughter, Corey Stoll (Dark Places, TV's House of Cards) as the villainous disciple and Bobby Cannavale (Blue Jasmine, Chef) as a stepfather to Lang's daughter, as well as Michael Pena (End of Watch, American Hustle), rapper Tip ""T I"" Harris and David Dastmalchian (The Glass Menagerie, Buried Child) as Lang's amusing but resourceful friends.In this day and age where everyone takes everything too seriously, this is one superhero movie that you'll fine immensely entertaining and enjoyable, without compromising on storytelling and action. Oh, you should also stick around to watch not one, but two end credit scenes which will eventually take the Internet by storm.",8/10
Ant-Man (2015),"Ant-Man has been through a very long development, it was started with Edgar Wright committing to write and direct the film, but years went by and Marvel finally has a studio of its own, manipulations do compromise Wright's vision which lead him leaving the project. In spite of that issue, the film spares much of his screenplay as it still has his trademarks all over the place. While it's delightful to notice those sequences being left intact, there is still a dejected feeling of what it could have been if he actually handled it entirely. For now, most of the style is basic Marvel. As a movie itself, it's quite refreshing to see a superhero film that doesn't contain much heavy handed explosions compared to the last few films they gave us. And it's a good reminder that joy can still be found in this genre even at its smaller scale, thanks to its engaging cast and downright appealing personality.The movie doesn't involve stopping some mass destruction or a general build up for future installments (the reference still exists, but isn't exactly the priority.) People may brag about this as going back to the basic mold of origin stories where you see outcasts living in a city having unexpected fate of becoming a superhero. The difference however is the premise is a lot sillier that is taken with vast self-awareness through that concept. The entirety is basically a mix between family drama and smart comedy. The comedic side is where it thoroughly shines, the film finding energy through its visuals and each actor's charisma. The drama on the other hand is basically to establish the character's pathos through their backstories. It's not quite subtle, but fits enough to breathe after a set of sillier spectacles.The major plot is basically just a heist, except the main character has the ability to alter his own scale while spectators and their enemies are constantly being flummoxed about what exactly is happening. It's simple, but there is so much going on and yet it is made easily exciting by its own personality and crazier imaginations, you can identify that most of the creativity came from Wright's idea. How the movie recreates his style from the script is fine and it's admirable to retain the same quirk and energy from the vision at some points. At the other scenes, it's typical Marvel flare, and as said, it looks cool, but it's more remarkable at the less conventional turns.Paul Rudd brings real charisma and some depth to Scott Lang, keeping him from being a generic anti-hero. Michael Douglas establishes actual depth within Hank Pym in a lot of moments. Corey Stoll embraces his almost unbelievably inhumane role, which strangely makes it an effectively menacing villain. Evangeline Lilly appears to be more than a love interest and that is alright. Michael Peña steals all of his scenes, which a role that could have been just another comic-relief, he makes all of his character's greatest comedic moments remarkably delightful.It's still quite inevitable to keep bringing up the supposed-to-be helmer of Ant-Man, because his fingerprints are really there, while it's actually nice to see it hinting every once in a while, it also feels somewhat exasperating for what daring opportunity it could have been. We'll never know the answer. Still, Ant-Man brings a sheer amount of fun. It's filled with comicbook enthusiasm and memorable laughs that appropriately sticks through its actually preposterous property. The cast helps bringing all of it to life, from levity to gravity. The action is executed with affecting weirdness. Ant-Man is best when it's weirder, because that is where it speaks its own flavor.",8/10
Ant-Man (2015),"AntMan is a lesser know character of marvels but by no means does that effect the quality of this movie. First off I thought that the casting of this film wasn't going to work, that been Paul Rudd mainly, just because I have read a few of the AntMan comics and didn't think it was going to work, I was wrong he is brilliant, hilarious and believable, all of the jokes he made actually made laugh out load which doesn't happen much. Michael Pena was great in this film, he plays the same kind of character he always seems too, but it really works, especially the story telling scenes were hilarious. This was a all round well cast film.The action and CGI Was great, on first thoughts I thought when AntMan shrinks down that the CGI would take you out of the movie but let me tell you it doesn't, it's awesome! Especially seeing the world from that size and scenes where AntMan is shrinking and enlarging when fighting i thought would get a little too much but the honestly don't.All around I AntMan felt different to all the other MCU movies that have come out, but a good different.    A well cast,directed and acted film that will be a welcome addition to my marvel collection.",9/10
Ant-Man (2015),"Once upon a time, Ant-Man was the Marvel movie to beat. A founding Avenger with less baggage of expectation, Ant-Man allowed the studio increasing danger of collapsing under the titanic weight of their own 'universe-building' a chance to shake things up with something small (ha), intimate, and quirky. Paired with the eclectic stylistic flair and consummate comedic timing of visionary writer/director Edgar Wright, Ant-Man was primed to become the breath of fresh air in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Alas. Wright's departure from the project, followed by shady, last minute rewrites, and the hiring of Peyton Reed, best known for helming despicably generic attempts at comedy, didn't bode well. But Marvel's impeccable track record and the inspired casting of Paul Rudd suggested there was still Hope (ha) an enjoyable romp could be salvaged out of the film's prior potential. Indeed, it's hard not to sneer that the film's theme of ""second chances,"" uttered roughly 1800 times by Michael Douglas with all the subtlety of a children's bedtime story, reads as a meta plea for clemency on behalf of the studio. And yet, even with this growing backlog of worrisome evidence against it, none could have predicted the final product to come. Ant-Man is, not to mince words, an insultingly poor film. Inexcusably lazy, under-thought, clichéd, soulless the list of adjectives is endless. Purportedly structured around a heist narrative, the miserable excuse for a script slaps together a slew of loathsome narrative crutches (released con coaxed into ""one last job"", disgraced dad trying to win back custody rights to his daughter, emotionally distant genius forced to confront the demons of his pastyawn), glued together with laughably contrived MCU tie-ins (a dire prologue tacked on to remind audiences that Marvel's Agent Carter still exists, an Avengers cameo so embarrassingly out of place I won't dare spoil it here, ugh) in a shamefully textbook example of 'safe studio filmmaking'. One would imagine that after the rampant success of the eccentric, daring Guardians of the Galaxy Marvel would push the envelope even further into the realm of clever humour and weird levity. Instead, Reed inexplicably stoops to sassy 'comedic relief' side characters that would have felt stale in the 1980s, otherwise leaning on Paul Rudd's indestructibly affable charisma to keep the film afloat. And though Rudd is nearly impossible to dislike, turning on the charm and puppy-dog pathos and mining the abysmal script for laughs like never before, even he can only do so much to save a sinking ship (it's ironic Rudd's Lang makes a Titanic reference). Running less than two hours and still feeling offensively overlong, Ant-Man plods along at an insomnia-curing pace (Reed may as well have re-titled the film Slug-Man), counterbalancing a stupefying long training montage with terse monologues about morality so repetitive there is a legitimate worry of having entered the simulacrum of Groundhog Day. The sole consolation: the film's visual effects, while often looking slapdash and rushed, do conjure an ant-sized handful of fascinating imagery. Lang's first shrinking experience into the suddenly desolate wasteland of a bathtub provides a blip of entertainment, and there is brief joy – nay, perhaps even a chuckle or two – to be found in his ant-training escapades (watching him surf through a drainpipe on a skittering carpet of ants is a highlight). Similarly, Lang's accidental descent into the subatomic realm provides a gorgeous feast of Escher- influenced surrealism. But, before you know it, we're back to being pummelled senseless by cliché once again. Sigh.Speaking of pummelling: despite a surprisingly sound rationalization of the physicality of Ant- Man (small yet compact, ""like a bullet""), the film's action sequences are tragically sparse. It's a shame, as the unique size-changing fight choreography offers a few precious where the film momentarily sputters with some life and vigour. Surely a couple of minutes of Michael Douglas' droning could have been shaved off for a few more shots of unorthodox pounding? Ah, but that would require a director with even a skeletal grasp of energy, pace, or vision (ahem). Among the film's immeasurable log of missed opportunities: no Lang entering the human body and attacking from within, and not even a fleeting glimpse of a triumphant Giant-Man transformation (at least one climactic moment provides an ideal setup). And the Wasp? Shamefully, unforgivably absent. All the while, Christophe Beck's musical score bwomps away in the background, the most hackneyed pastiche of heroic musical clichés yet, and there are even a couple of moments where Reed has the gall to attempt to mimic Edgar Wright's trademark kinetic 'swish-pan' editing and cinematography. Rub salt in the gaping wound, why dontcha. The squandered potential on screen is almost too much to bear. Even the film's generally talented cast is Hopeless (see what I did there? I used the same joke twice. Just like Ant-Man) at providing any respite from the turgid mess surrounding them. Apart from Rudd – and even he starts to seem tired by the end – Michael Douglas snores through the film, his Hank Pym an unmistakably extraneous mentor archetype, while Evangeline Lily continues her Hobbit streak of astoundingly flat 'token action woman' cardboard cutouts. Corey Stoll, saddled with the worst lines the script has to offer (which is saying something), is so embarrassingly cartoonish here it almost overrides his previously impressive work in House of Cards, while poor Michael Peña is forced to constantly mug for increasingly cheap laughs as Lang's fellow ex-con buddy. The worst of the lot: Bobby Canavale's oafish cop/stepdad rival is hilariously out of place, while Judy Greer is given so little screen time as Lang's estranged wife she may as well have played the Invisible Woman. In conclusion (just to finish beating that dead horse): Edgar Wright once opined that ""the only bad films are dull films."" Ladies and gentlemen, Ant-Man is a bad film. -3/10",3/10
Ant-Man (2015),"I was not really aware of a Marvel character named Ant-Man until recently when articles and trailers about this film began coming out. I was not really that excited until I learned that he was actually one of the original Avengers, then that really got my interest piqued to go watch this one and learn about this previously unfamiliar superhero.Hank Pym was a noted scientist who discovered how to reduce the distance between atoms, enabling objects to be shrunk. Pym suppressed his discovery because of its dangers, which led to the death of his wife. Obsessed, his protégé Darren Cross eventually develops his own shrinking technology but with less than noble purposes in mind. In order to prevent potential disaster, Pym decided to recruit Scott Lang, an electronics engineer turned petty burglar, to steal Cross' Yellowjacket project. To be able to achieve this mission, Pym, along with his daughter Hope van Dyne, trained Lang to become a micro- superhero who can communicate and command ants to do his bidding -- the Ant-Man.I did not know anything about the Ant-Man, his origin and abilities going in, but this film made me a new fan of this cool superhero. Director Peyton Reed only had mostly comedies like ""Bring It On"" (2000), ""Down with Love"" (2003) and ""The Break-Up"" (2006) in his resume. But with his first foray into the superhero genre, he totally made ""Ant-Man"" an exciting and riveting film that holds your attention from beginning to end with its excellent action and crackling humor. Reed took over from original director/scriptwriter Edward Wright, who dropped out of the project citing creative differences with Disney. For me, the casting of 46 year old Paul Rudd in the lead role came totally from left field. Since his breakthrough role as Josh in ""Clueless"" (1995), Rudd was only relegated playing mainly supporting roles in small unmemorable comedies. However, like his ""Parks and Recreation"" co-star Chris Pratt's success as Peter Quill/Star Lord before him, Rudd actually fit right into character as Scott Lang. Rudd had that good-boy charm which was able to make us sympathetic to this small-time crook desperately wanting to do good for the sake of his daughter Cassie (played by Abby Ryder Fortson). Evangeline Lilly proved that the action skills she showed as the elf Tauriel in the last two Hobbit films were no fluke. Her Hope van Dyne is fierce with attitude, with toned arms and shoulders to boot. I do take exception to her annoying hairstyle that was reminiscent of that worn by Dallas Bryce Howard on ""Jurassic World"". What's up with that ""Dora""-do with the bangs and Hollywood nowadays?The role of Hank Pym could have been dry and didactic in the hands of another actor, but Michael Douglas really made this character vital and interesting. His sense of humor was on point. His was the character that was connected with everyone else being the original Ant-Man, and he had excellent working chemistry with everyone: Scott, Hope and villain Darren Cross (played by Corey Stoll).Michael Peña, David Dastmalchian and rapper T.I. played a comical trio of petty crooks with whom Scott hung around. They provide additional humor to the proceedings, especially when things get serious towards the climax. Bobby Cannavale played a clueless cop Paxton who is now the new husband of Scott's ex-wife Maggie (Judy Greer), and step father to Cassie. His character made Scott's life considerably more complicated.The technical aspects of this film were top rate, particularly the amazing visual effects. I really liked the scenes of Ant-Man interacting with the different types of ants. The fight scene of Ant-Man vs. a special guest Avenger was also very well-executed. Those scenes in little Cassie's room where there was a carpeted play area with a toy Thomas train running on its tracks was way better than how it looked in the trailer. The expert film editing was seamless even as scenes (and the sizes of the characters) were shifting so quickly. Aside from mentions of Stark, S.H.I.E.L.D. and the Avengers, there were also two scenes in the end credits (one mid-credit, and another one at the very end) which reveal how Ant-Man will fit into the current Marvel Cinematic Universe situation. Unlike the rather disappointing, heavy- handed ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" right before it, ""Ant-Man"" was entertaining beyond my expectations. Marvel does it again! 9/10.",9/10
Ant-Man (2015),"In 1989, the scientist Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) quits working for the S.H.I.E.L.D. when he discovers that they have unsuccessfully tried to replicate his shrinking technology named Ant-Man that he considers too dangerous for mankind. In the present days, Dr. Pym was forced by his daughter Hope van Dyne (Evangeline Lilly) and his former protégé Darren Cross (Corey Stoll) to leave his company Pym Technologies to them. Further, he finds that Darren is developing his own shrinking technology named Yellowjacket.Meanwhile, the small-time burglar Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is released from prison and welcomed by his former cell mate Luis (Michael Peña) that wants him to participate in a heist. However Scott wants to find an honest job to take care of his beloved daughter Cassie (Abby Ryder Fortson) that lives with his estranged wife Maggie (Judy Greer) and her future husband Detective Paxton (Bobby Cannavale). However his criminal record does not give a chance to him and he accepts to participate in the heist of the house of a millionaire. He finds only a special suit in the safe and he is arrested again by the police. Soon he learns that he is part of the scheme plotted by Dr. Pym and Hope to make him a superhero wearing the suit and save the world destroying the Yellowjacket. Without any alternative, Scott is trained by Dr. Pym and Hope in the beginning of an incredible adventure. ""Ant-Man"" is a highly entertaining adventure with another Marvel (unknown) hero. The plot is very funny and it is funnier to read reviews showing plot holes based on science and forgetting that the story is based on a comic magazine. The special effects are also great and it is good to see Evangeline Lilly again. There are two scenes entwined in the credits, the last one in the very end. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Homem-Formiga"" (""Ant-Man"")",8/10
Ant-Man (2015),"Ant-Man (2015)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is released from prison and plans on going straight but that doesn't go as planned but he's recruited by Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) to try out a suit that manages to shrink his size while making him even stronger. Soon Ant-Man has to try and stop a bad guy (Corey Stoll) trying to sell the secret.ANT-MAN is a film that really took me by surprise. I'm not a comic book person so I wasn't familiar with this character or the story. I was really shocked at how entertaining the personal drama was as well as how exciting the action was. When I first saw the trailer I couldn't help but think of HONEY, I SHRUNK THE KIDS and this film actually benefits from the same thing that movie did and that's the rather cool effect of being small and surrounded by large, everyday items.This is certainly one aspect that makes the film so entertaining because the entire idea of someone being able to shrink and then go back to their regular size in the matter of seconds is just fun. Even more fun is the way he is trained into becoming this warrior because it not only adds some great action scenes but also some very good laughs. You've got the action and the laughs but I thought the film also sold the personal drama that the main characters have.A lot of credit has to go to the cast for pulling this off. Rudd is as perfect as Ant-Man as Robert Downey, Jr. is as Iron Man. The casting was simply perfect because Rudd can perfectly handle the drama, the comedy and the action and he makes for a complete character. Douglas also adds a lot to the film in his supporting role as does Stoll as the villain. Michael Pena and Bobby Cannnavale are both good in their supporting bits as is Evangeline Lilly in her role.ANT-MAN also benefits from clocking in under two hours as the film never seems too long. The story isn't dragged on and instead we're given non-stop action and fun. There have been many good movies made from Marvel comics but ANT-MAN is certainly among the best.",8/10
Ant-Man (2015),One of the best Marvel films . It more like a classic Sci-fi ---Creature Feature hybrid with splash of super-hero fun for good measure.Paul Rudd did a great job of being a guy who is struggling in life and made some bad decisions even if they were for good intentions. He got the humour right and played the action right as well. Michael Douglas was well cast as Hank Pym and the story was really good from start to finish. The humour in this film was brilliant . Excellent cameo by Stan Lee . The visuals are fantastic . I thoroughly recommend seeing this film as it stands out well as it's own movie rather than a stepping stone to others.,10/10
